5,IBM," I’d like to point out that the stock also dropped steadily last week. It’s fluctuating between $28-31 today, when earnings were supposedly made public for the first time. The consistent downward movement from $38 last Monday down to $31 Friday was a lot more significant than the “dip” we are seeing today post-earnings. 

It almost feels like the mediocre earnings are priced in at this point given performance last week, and that maybe last week’s dip was based on premature knowledge of the earnings report. Not sure what other publicly facing information would lead to such a significant dip while legitimate “negative” PR from today’s earnings shows a much smaller impact. As usual, PLTR announces good news (last week’s IBM contract is the latest example) and then the stock goes red, lol. 

Personally I think the stock might continue to dip after lockup expires. I’m bullish long term but this could be painful for a while. I’ll likely increase my position if it closes in around $25 and then not look at it again for 3 years lol. While insiders likely understand how valuable PLTR can be long term there could be a strong incentive to take cash now and leverage it elsewhere in this infinite bull market rather than sit on a bunch of PLTR shares that might not print for another 3+ years.",Vercify,32,/r/investing/comments/ll5ng9/palantir_stock_drops_after_earnings/gnnxwmg/,0.022,0.846,0.132,0.9733

Remember when ""Big Data"" was all the rage about 8 years ago? This is finally the result of that, and I think if their solutions continue to be fully scalable this will shape the industry expectation for data analytics going forward.

Other companies are already in this space, but there is a slower adoption rate to distributed computing and graph data structures. Mostly because people think, ""No. I don't need all that.""

Nasdaq composite index is about +25% divergent from 200 day MA (Wowee)

OTC US composite is about +30% (That's a hot potato!)

During the dot com bubble, nasdaq composite diverged about +35% and with current ""market trends"" I would expect to see the most dramatic divergence on the US OTC so I am bullish that we haven't hit the brim (lmao yes) of an obviously unsustainable trend, which may very well exceed historical market examples.

170,MCF," The rise in gas prices is priced in I think. It's much more important to look at nymex prices to get a sense for the long term impact of this. Most utilities and natural gas marketers/suppliers but their gas well in advance to hedge and lock in prices, they also will often in lock in the basis Costs. 

What is basis you might ask? It's the cost differential between the price of gas at a particular point and the price of the gas at the central trading hub of Henry Hub in Louisiana. So for instance of HH gas is trading at $3 and the price of gas at say Tetco M3 (near Philly) is $4, then the basis is $1 and the cost of the gas is $3. You can see that as markets in TX and Midwest jumped to as high as $300 Dth the basis is huge. Yet this is temporary, as generators come back online and as weather warms, (Mid-March and later predicted by forecasters to be unusually warm) the basis costs and the spot market and futures market will decline. 

At the same time as weather will turn from providing price support to being a negative for energy prices, we will likely continue to receive good news on the covid situation and easing of restrictions as well as fiscal stimulus and continued monetary policy support. These three factors will help to support demand expectations and prices for the next few months. 

Is $60 per barrel oil and and $3 MCF/DTh gas sustainable? Maybe but I don't think it's going to go much higher. I do think foreign producers (which are often largely governmentally controlled (think Saudi Arabia/Brazil/Russia/Venezuela) will not be boosting production in the short term as they want these prices to stick (and US energy firms are loth to make further investments after years of leverage during the shale boom and price expectations that never materialized).

173,BTU," Yup! Buffett knows how to play his cards right. Plus he knows that regulatory pressure is moving against new pipelines so any existing pipelines are going to be cash flowing like crazy. What happens is people bid on contracts for the pipeline capacity. It means you can arbitrage  the price differences between major hubs. For example, say you have capacity on xyz pipline which connects hub 1 to hub 2. If the price of gas on hub 1 is $5 and the price on hub 2 is $500 then you can move gas from hub 1 to hub 2 and basically make $495 for every million BTU of gas you move. So if the pipeline capacity is  being restricted then it means the existing pipeline capacity is more valuable to commodity traders. Thus, when the contracts are renewed, the big energy firms will have to bid more for the capacity contract and thus the pipeline owner is the big winner in the game.",Own-Revenue9302,9,/r/investing/comments/lkq9ok/natural_gas_next_day_deliveries_3mmbtu_to_600mmbtu/gnm5n0c/,0.042,0.874,0.084,0.8066

You're acting like Reddit was wrong about the yield curve. Look again!

We had the first yield curve inversions around January 2019. We had a stock market crash in February 2020, which follows the historical pattern perfectly. By March 2020 the yield curve was steep again, and stocks shot up. Yield curve inversion remains nearly 100% accurate at predicting recession.

Engineering: The benefit of launching from 50,000 feet is you don’t need to use nearly as much fuel to create the thrust required to reach space. The airplane design would allow this craft to launch from any traditional airport. I don’t think it’s fair to say this is a engineering flaw since it’s a relatively new concept. Once the design is perfected it’s possible that another company sees how they do it and they do it better, I agree on that point, but this is quite novel.

Space Tourism: it is certainly speculation how this industry will take off, so far over 600 people have purchased tickets and that number would be much, much larger however SPCE stopped selling tickets until they get these final test flights under their belt. The next year or so will be them running the already purchased flights. I don’t think that’s a fair comparison, Mt. Everest costs around $120k for a full custom climb and that’s climbing Mt. Everest. Like that’s not for everyone, that is difficult, long, and extremely dangerous. I’m actually super impressed that they see even 1000 climbers per year. Same notion for the South Pole. This will be easy. You as the tourist get into the ship, you go up, you come back down, you’re now an astronaut. Even if it only sees 1000 per year as well that’s $250M/yr in revenue. Their expectations are much higher as they are predicting $1B/spaceport/year.

Hypersonic Travel: Concorde isn’t good, there is no good way to fly this fast over any landmass. It needs to have an altitude of 60,000+ for this to work.

Do you have anything that shows how much fuel they're saving? My intuition is that any fuel savings would be negligible (getting up to sub-orbital space doesn't require a massive amount of fuel anyways) but I'm open to opposing evidence. 

> I don’t think it’s fair to say this is a engineering flaw since it’s a relatively new concept. 

It's not really a new concept. Like I pointed out, the USAF was doing basically the same thing 60 years ago. I take back what I said about Virgin Galactic's approach being unique, it's really not new at all now that I think about it.

> Concorde isn’t good, there is no good way to fly this fast over any landmass. 

Understand that the reason the Concorde failed wasn't because of restrictive flight paths, it's because it was too expensive for what was offered. The Concorde was fast, but very expensive and you're stuck in a cramped seat. In contrast, traditional international business class you pay less, the flight takes longer, but you get a nice lay-down seat and a bunch of other perks. Turns out most people prefer the latter, especially now that in-flight internet is a thing so you can stay in touch even while in the air.

> But even if you assume they share this market with 4 other companies then that would be the part of my DD where I say imagine they control 20% of the market. That’s still $230/share without any other revenue streams baked in.

Keep in mind that none of these companies, including SPCE, are getting into the hypersonic travel market as defined by that ARK Analyst. You seem to be under the impression that a Mach 3 aircraft could travel around the globe in 90 minutes which isn't the case. And it's not going to have the fuel capacity to do that anyways.

I have $2000 to invest and looking for it to make more money than it is sitting in my savings. The goal is to hold it for the longer term, but I also want it to remain relatively liquid.

32, US

Recently laid off but have 6-12 months of savings to fall on, plus activity job hunting.

I’m willing to accept some risk, but not to the point of playing at a blackjack table. In Vanguard’s terms, mostly a 4 and maybe a little 5.

I have no big debts beside monthly rent and bills.

I’m thinking of going:

50% VUG
35% VGT
5% VOO (I already have $100 in there, so figured I’d just leave it)
5% SNE (I’ve read a lot of positive analysis on it, and it seems to be an undervalued stock that has 1 year growth targets between 5-50%)

Is price due to say a company of MC=50m (price at $5) receives 50m in stock purchases, with price steadily increasing until it doubles ($10) when MC = 100m.

Or

Is price defined by buyer and seller, so if everyone decides not only sell at $10 (2x day before) then the market cap is now at 100m even though 50m of purchases have not occurred.

After everything that happened and all of the information that came to light about Robinhood  I decided to transfer my brokerage account to Webull from RH. 

I just finished with that process today and finally see my stocks in WeBull after 7 long business days. That said, when I went to check in on them and see their progress after not being able to see them for the past week, I saw that all of my partial partial that I had held in RH dis not transfer into Webull, as well as 4-5 of my positions have not transferred over. 

That’s not a huge deal, as Webull said that some stocks may take longer to transfer but these irregulaties combined with the fact that my account balance is a full $1.5k lower than when I started the transfer and my cash balance is $100 less has me worried (Webull stated they would take care of $75 of transfer fees with a transfer of over $2,000).

I know Webull does not support partial stocks, but I assumed they would have converted the partial stocks into cash on the transfer. 

All that said, has anybody gone through this process? If so is this something I need to start remedying with Webull now? Is this something that will get taken care of in time? Or is this going to be an expensive learning experience?

294,GROW," Start by speaking with a lender/bank. I recommend starting with a credit union that services mortgages. The lender will lay out all the requirements and pre-approve you for up to a certain amount, and they will order the appraisal once you have a purchase contract hammered out, so don’t worry about orchestrating that process. FHA loans are a good option for first time buyers, as they can secure a home with the lowest down payment. If, for some reason, you go with a conventional loan, plan on a 20% down payment to avoid paying property mortgage insurance (PMI). If you can’t avoid paying PMI, you can always refinance when you have reached 20% equity in the home, BUT BEWARE if rates go up, you may not be any better off, AND you will be starting the clock on a new mortgage along with paying closing costs again... it makes most sense to take advantage of rock bottom rates now, avoid PMI, and ride the loan out. In terms of length of loan, 15 20 or 30 year loan? Depends on what type of person you are. Some people love to be debt free sooner, but it is important to understand (and counterintuitive) that mortgage debt has the power to GROW YOUR WEALTH. This works by borrowing the present value and getting the asset now (hopefully it appreciates over time too) and making payments with future dollars which are worth less due to inflation, complimented by your increased earnings as you progress in your career. If you have extra money, invest rather than paying down the cheapest debt you’ll ever see; the compounding yield of investments will far outpace the interest on your mortgage. One caveat, if you have any high interest debt, pay that down before investing. With this in mind, pay the smallest down payment possible and keep as much of your money invested as you can. 

Now, how to seal the deal? You can contact a real estate attorney and ask how much they will charge to draft a contract and walk you through the rest of the process to closing, but considering everything you have described, I think it’s best to contact a real estate agent to have him/her serve as a “transactional agent” in which they facilitate everything involved and do not represent/advocate for either the buyer or seller. This should be 3% or less of the sale price, you can offer to pay for it or split the cost. Generally, the default is for the seller to pay both realtors, but you’ll be hiring just one, and if you want the seller to have the $80K, just bump up the sale price to offset this cost and roll it into the loan, you’ll never notice such a marginal increase in your bill. 

It is very important that you do get a home inspection and meet the inspector so that he can show you everything (like specific issues, where water/gas shutoffs are etc) and ask all the questions/concerns you have. If major problems are discovered, your purchase contract should have an “inspection resolution deadline” in which you guys can either renegotiate price or the seller agrees to fix the issue or a combination of both, or kill the deal. 

Also, if you casually shop around on the internet for real estate interest rate calculators, keep in mind that only describes the loan, it does not include insurance, yearly taxes, or PMI. The online calculators describe unrealistically low mortgage payments. Your ACTUAL mortgage payment includes and coordinates everything within one bill. 

Hope this is clear and helpful. Best of luck!",nderpandy,1,/r/investing/comments/ll0qce/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gnnpci0/,0.061,0.799,0.14,0.9948

306,AMC," First, my advice is to get rid of AMC. It was a shitty company (for investing purposes) before the pandemic, it got shittier when it became a meme stock, and it won't turn around by pixie dust magic. Sell and put it in something productive. Like paying debt or something that actually will do well in the long term.

As for taxes, assuming the tax code remains the same: Use a tax-advantaged account if you can (IRA, 401K). If not, you pay taxes on any profit you make. You buy something for $100 and sell it $110, you pay a part of the $10 gain to Uncle Sam.

How much you pay depends on mainly two things:

1. How long have you held the stock
2. How much money do you make overall

If you hold a stock for more than a year, you usually pay ""long term capital gains"" tax rate which can be 0, 15 or 20% based on #2 (prob. 15 for you).

If you hold it less than a year, then any gains are taxed at your ""ordinary income"" rate, like your salary. That rate is probably 22-24% for you.

Dividends are taxed similarly.

You might also have to pay NIIT (3.8%) and state taxes based on where you live and how much you make. If you lose money on a trade, it gets a bit complicated. See a tax advisor or read up on it.

1. Foreign ordinary shares (end in F) do get charged significant fees to trade at some brokerages - I've seen fees as high as $50 in some cases (which is ridiculous) so ask your broker first before buying.

2. ADRs (end in Y) do charge minor fees. A lot of ADRs are a ratio of the original shares - for example, you may see a case of 2 ADRs = one ordinary. You can find out more information about ADRs (including ratios for each ADR) at the JP Morgan-run adr.com

3. Sometimes you will run into OTC foreign shares that barely trade or that don't trade at all (no bid/ask) Sometimes there is no OTC option for a foreign company. If something barely trades or especially if there isn't an option, you can look to buy on the home/foreign market via Fidelity or other brokerages that offer global trading.

4. If you see an OTC option for a foreign stock that has decent-to-significant volume (to offer a random example, something like Tencent or LVMH), that should be fine. If it's a foreign ordinary (symbol ends in F), just be sure to ask your broker to make sure there's not a fee for foreign ordinary share trading.

A more middle of the line, less pessimistic forecast comes from Vanguard. See page 38 for expected 10 year returns. Also, see page 37 for the effect of interest rates on CAPE.

Personally, I think it's a great time to rotate some money into value and international.

I do think FANG stocks keep growing, but valuations have mostly gone up faster than earnings for the last few years. Not saying you'll lose money in them, necessarily. Just hard to imagine another decade of extreme outperformance for them. Earnings have to catch up to valuations. And it's hard for them to 10X again, on the basis of size alone. If Apple does 2X better than the market again, it's like 10% of the market. If it does 10X better, it's 50%.

350,UK," ""investing in innovation"" - literally everybody, it seems (which is a tad concerning.) It feels like people have crowded into ""forward thinking"" themes and already moved onto investing in ""what might be big 3-5 years from now"" and invested there as if it will be a big thing tomorrow.

As for ""innovation"", I think for a long time there was growth and now there's an increasing amount of funds that are focused on more speculative/aggressive/""disruptive"" growth. I've also called this ""swing for the fences"" growth - as the Baillie Gifford (and Baillie Gifford's UK growth flagship Scottish Mortgage being a particular hyper-growthy beneficiary last year) manager notes below, get one or two home runs and it will make up for the inevitable strike-outs.

It's trying to be increasingly thinking forward and trying to invest in further out trends and themes vs a growth fund that is in Starbucks, Nike and LVMH and the like.

""When the internet stock bubble popped in 2000, Baillie Gifford suffered a setback, but as investors fled companies like Amazon, the firm backed Jeff Bezos’ vision. It was Amazon’s remarkable resilience and success that birthed the firm’s think-happy-thoughts-first, be-critical-later approach. Its timing was perfect. Technology giants like Amazon, Google and Microsoft are now carrying the S&P 500. “We started noticing that big companies got better and got stronger, and their returns got greater as they grew, rather than the reverse,” Anderson says.

**“If you can just hit one or two of those exceptional companies that really drive markets over the long run, then they’ll pay for the inevitable mistakes,”** says Tom Slater, 42, who co-manages some flagship funds alongside Anderson. By 2012, the firm latched onto emerging trends like cloud computing and Asian tech leaders like Alibaba and Tencent.""

If the stock price rises high enough, they might even be able to chunk some debt down with a public offering. Their new CEO also just doubled their investment into EVs.

369,CRSP," I also do some of this. I have browsed through a lot of the ARK ETFs and have picked out a few of the holdings I really think will do well and bought them. I however generally buy much smaller amts of the individual stocks (SPCE is exception), than what I own in the funds which are more diversified. A few of my favorites from ARK ETFSs that I own the individual stocks are SPCE, CRSP NVTA TDOC OTRK. I kind of stumbled upon TDOC before I realized ARK was an investor as I had bought LVGO at a very low price in March and held it until the shares got converted over to TDOC shares. SPCE is one of my favorites right now as they are close to commercial flights and tons of demand. Im not worried about the flight delay as I would rather have them be safe and get it right vs. some problem with the flight setting them further back. It is a little risky if the flights dont go well and they have to shoot for commercial flights further out, but Im looking at a 5 to 10 year horizon where the hypersonic flights will be operating as I believe this will be their main revenue stream. CRSP is awesome and seems to be manipulated with current selling, it is risky as it is based on drug approval long term, but this seems likely and their market cap is low, also a bunch of selling since it hit 220. The SC treatment alone is estimated to be worth 4billion a year, but I predict some success with diabetes which will make the most revenue in the future. Watch Human Nature on Netflix, very interesting. They are also not too far off in the development pipeline for the SC treatment (near phase 3), and its curative.

374,SO," Oh yeah I forgot old people still care about those awards. 

I literally could not tell you the difference between Golden globes, Emmys, Academy Awards etc.

In my opinion they don't know good shows. Very rarely does a film with actual technical skill make it, just whatever studio has paid the most money to critics so it gets a nomination. 

Honestly the level of complexity, detail, world building, lore building and character story and development, (along with killer soundtracks) in the story of Steven Universe (a cartoon) is SO MUCH higher quality than anything I've seen Hollywood put out in... well at least the last 30 years. Honestly all the good movies are based on books with the exception of Star Wars. Every one hates the movies and loves the lore for that lol. 

Example: I've watched Moana literally 100 times this month thanks to my toddler and it took me till now to realize the style of clothing for Maui is the same as Moana's ancestors, really giving him an ""out of time"" feeling, considering Moana and her people use dyed woven fabrics while Maui and her ancestors just have branches for pants basically. When you pop that movie on a 4k TV (something we didn't have in 2016) you can see even more detail than in theaters. Did it win visual effects?  Did it win an academy award?
