They have a history of not meeting standards. They diluted to raise funds for TNX-102 SL, which was their treatment developed to treat fibromyalgia, which failed massively. They then tried to use TNX-102 SL to treat PTSD, which also failed massively. Then they did a reverse spilt.

I am sure there is enough money to go around, but with Pelosi and likely the greenest tech in the industry I am sure there will be some laws passed giving tax incentives to use the greenest tech or even just more government funding.

All I can say is SXOOF is 60-70million market cap and if it 10x from here it still would be almost 40-50% less the ABML's around 1.2 BILLION market cap.  So you can see SXOOF has A LOT of room to run (10x) and still be a bargain considering they do other stuff as well (one of which is first in class in lithium extraction from clay).  

Great possibilities.  Now let see if they come to life.

1.  The original lithium extraction from clay was done by outside third party lab in 2020.  The battery recycling using same tech was done inhouse (last couple of months).  
2.  Finances as mentioned to another poster are MUCH different last 1 month.  $10 MILLION dollar private placement done and some of the debentures erased by an eager Mr. Pelosi buying them and converting to common shars.
3.  As far as I know no government funding thus far.  I am pretty sure they will get some since they are building out a plant in Canada by end of year.  With Mr. Pelosi I don't think getting government funding is going to be a big deal on the U.S. or Canada side if that is what they want.

42,ON," EV Batteries Recovery Tests Results: Lithium. 

-FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Montréal, March 18, 2021 – St-Georges Eco-Mining Corp. (CSE: SX) (OTC: SXOOF) (FSE: 85G1) is pleased to provide an update on the initial testing phase of an array of electric vehicles batteries it received at its testing installations in Québec. 

The Company has completed EV battery characterization for the following car makers: Tesla, General Motors (GM), Ford, Toyota, and Nissan. The batteries were sourced from industry aggregators. The Company’s chemists and metallurgists created synthetic powder clones of the metal’s components allowing the testing’s acceleration. 99.99% of the lithium leached in solution after 5 minutes at low temperature and without applying pressure. 

This is in line with the results obtained previously by the Company’s metallurgical team that was able to leach more than 99% of the cobalt and the nickel contained in the batteries. Furthermore, the aluminium 
foil used to hold the different metals in the batteries’ core remains intact and can be recycled. 

The Company expects to confirm these results via a series of pilot tests as it now is in possession of car makers’ specific testing protocols. Testing will be documented and independently confirmed. The Company expects to initiate the next phase, metals purification, in April. The Company hopes to be able to reduce processing time and increase acid re-usage. 

EVSX and St-Georges have also identified some of the key equipment required from industrial equipment manufacturers. They expect to be able to receive the electrolysis equipment during the month of May, allowing the manufacture of lithium hydroxide. 

The Company had already disclosed on February 22, 2021, that additional tests to optimize the process of recovery of critical elements were to be conducted using synthetic compounds to move the development 
along faster. Work is ongoing at multiple locations, speeding up delivery and further protecting intellectual property.

LAS VEGAS, Jan. 28, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Barrel Energy Inc. (the “Company” or “Barrel”) (OTC: BRRL) is pleased to provide an update on the company’s recent activities.

The CEO of Barrel Energy Mr. Craig Alford is, at this time, also assisting Altair International Corp. (ATAO: OTC) to develop ATAO’s prized lithium/rare earth and gold assets in Nevada. Mr. Alford was also the founder of American Battery Metals Corp. (ABML:OTCQB). The Chairman of Barrel Energy, Mr. Harp Sangha and Mr. Alford are also the founders of Lithium Now.

Barrel has recently been in discussions with St-Georges Eco-Mining Corp. (CSE: SX) (OTC: SXOOF) (FSE: 85G1) (“St-Georges”) a Canadian public company engaged in the development of new Lithium extraction technologies regarding several sites for their Lithium processing technology centers within the southwest U.S.

Barrel is considering location sites with a specific eye toward cost efficiency and process permitting. Access to infrastructure, sufficient power, transport and nearby source material and demand are all factors for project viability.

Your getting to sell your gold directly to the consumer at market prices. Next step should be to build in a system to trade tokens out for physical gold delivered and you have a moving market that allows them to offload the gold without expanding the outstanding tokens.,Kierik,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/m8m4qw/aabbg_token_released_silently_before_press/griax3d/,0.14,0.828,0.032,-0.845

Guess what? 

\- Starbree is currently only surviving thanks to Payday 2 and this for at least 2 years until 2023 when Payday 3 will come out (OR NOT ! It might be postponed, we never know)

\- Payday 2 is an old game. It regained momentum in 2020 thanks to lockdowns, but now we have vaccins, so that momentum is about to go back into travels and holidays.

\- Did you check Steam stats and the subreddit? All figures are dropping for the past 4 months: In terms of players and interest.

\- The latest DLC didn't revive the flame in terms of player base nor trend.

\- Their only plan for the next 2 freaking years is releasing DLC and DLC and DLC that bring the same formula: Skins and missions. Nothing outbreaking, just your usual stuff. 

\- Who even said that Payday 3 will be success? Their last game was a totally piece of junk, it was 3 years ago. Their second last game was 8 years ago. 8 LONG YEARS AGO. And it was payday 2.

&#x200B;

All of these points are the reason why it's a pennystock and it will stay a pennystock until at least 2023 if it's not 2024.

There is no reason to invest in Starbree today instead of next year. It is guaranteed your money won't move at all (actually it might even drop below 1 SEK who knows?).
