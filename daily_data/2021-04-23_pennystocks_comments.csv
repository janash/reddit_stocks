26,CTXR," One of my screens is 52 week high, and only OTC stocks. I will look for stocks that might have been beaten down over last 5 years, also in accumulation period, and ready to possibly break out. I will look at weekly chart first. ATMS had been kind of in an accumulation period since 2019, and even had a big positive volume spike about 6 months ago I believe. So I was going to do was put in orders for around .30 and accumulate over 6 months or so and wait and hopefully wait for a pop. Got lucky and pop happened in like 3 days. I didn‚Äôt get a chance to buy a whole lot though. Not complaining. The whole thing was luck. I decided this time to not even research the company a whole lot.

27,CTXR," Lately, I use barchart for 2 screens.
1. On barchart, click on stock link.
Under Market Pulse, I click on ‚ÄúNew Highs & Lows‚Äù
There will be 3 drop downs. On the one that says ‚ÄúAll US Exchanges‚Äù, I change it to OTC-US
Then all I do is look for the stocks that are under $2. I usually look at the weekly or monthly stocks chart on tradingview.com. I like their charting better.
Then I look for a stock that looks like it is close to breaking out of a year or longer range. CTXR and LONCF are two charts right now I am looking at, but haven‚Äôt bought any yet.

The only other screen I use is the same as above, but inside of 52 week high in the drop down, I change it to all time high. I don‚Äôt care about price on this screen. I own a decent number of OTC stocks that are not pennies that I got from this screen.

Also, it seems like my screens are more for investment time length rather than quick high fliers. I can possibly hold some of these for awhile. I never really could screen for those quick to the moons  well.

I don't usually trade pennies but bought calls for their earnings next week and shares I'm holding long term.

73,DDD," Good question. The company's procedures are one time and preclinical results have shown drastic improvement in test subjects. The company's tech could take those suffering with common diseases who are being treated long-term with meds and allow them to have a procedure that could almost return them to normal and at worst offer them much better quality of life. For example, the 15 patients in the company's published study suffering from DDD reported an average pain of 8.9 out of 10 initially versus 1.3 at 12 months from having the procedure. That doesn't happen with meds for a person suffering from this disease. I hope that answers your question.",Cire_NojH,4,/r/pennystocks/comments/mx1zdq/take_a_look_at_celz_before_it_takes_off/gvlk32l/,0.132,0.76,0.108,-0.6249

75,RS," Here's the likely the big reason (I went back and checked):

""On February 23, 2021, the Company filed with the SEC its Schedule 14C, Preliminary Information Statement, providing notice that the Board of Directors and the holders of a majority of our shares entitled to vote had approved and authorized the following actions:

(2) That the Board be authorized to implement through the amendment to our Articles of Incorporation a reverse stock split of the Company‚Äôs Common Stock by a ratio of not less than 1-for-10 and not more than 1-for-2,000, (the ‚ÄúReverse Split‚Äù), at any time prior to the one year anniversary of the filing of the Definitive Information Statement, with the Board having the discretion to determine whether or not the Reverse Split is to be effected, and if effected, the exact ratio for the Reverse Split within the above range.""

So, a very large RS is possibly going to happen only 2 years after their last RS. Note that they do have a pending AS reduction from the same 14C filing, which is nice and all but.. 1:2000 is a very large RS and I wouldn't be excited about the AS decrease cause it's likely only possible (barring a financial miracle for the company) in conjunction with the RS.

81,ADX," Bottomed out support at .0012

Bought at 300,000 at .0018 at the .618 fib once it broke resistance. [https://snipboard.io/rRNLZa.jpg](https://snipboard.io/rRNLZa.jpg)

4h Candle on 4/23 broke, cleared and closed above previous 4h green candle .0021 on 4/1.

No resistance to .003.

Should easily surge to .004 if it break .003 double top, which would make it triple top sometime in the near future.

* Trend Analysis
   * GTEH  appears to be consolidating within a longer term uptrend. Shares are  presently above the 200-day moving average, which is rising along with  the 10-day moving average. However, the Average Directional Index, or  ADX, is below 20, indicating that shares have exhibited sideways  movement recently. Comparative Relative Strength analysis shows that  this issue is lagging the S&P 500.As of 4:00 PM ET Friday, 04/23/2021
* Momentum
   * Momentum  for GTEH is strongly bullish. The 14-period Slow Stochastic Oscillator  is rising, as investors pay higher prices for shares.As of 4:00 PM ET Friday, 04/23/2021
* Volume
   * Today,  218,438,113 shares of GTEH traded hands, in-line with the 232,068,618  share daily average during the last twelve months. The On Balance Volume  indicator (OBV) shows that longer term selling pressure has given way  to near term accumulation by traders.As of 4:00 PM ET Friday, 04/23/2021
* Volatility
   * Volatility, measured using the width of the Bollinger Bands¬Æ,  is extremely low, resulting in a condition called the Bollinger Band  Squeeze. Bollinger Band Squeezes tend to precede major price breakouts,  although they do not predict which direction the new trend will take.
