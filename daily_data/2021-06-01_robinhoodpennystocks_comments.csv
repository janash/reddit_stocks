43,GOED," Manipulation is probably minimal now. It was around $7/ before this:

To start off with, 1847 Goedeker¬†announced an underwritten public offering of 91,111,111 units.

Each of these units includes one share of GOED stock and a warrant to purchase another share.

These units are selling for $2.25 and the warrant is exercisable for that same price.

Those warrants can be exercised at any time and started trading today under the GOED WS stock ticker.

1847 Goedeker expects gross proceeds from the offering to be $205 million before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering expenses.

GOED plans to use part of the funds to fuel its transaction to acquire Appliances Connection.

The remaining will be used for general corporate purposes.

The proposed underwritten offering also includes an option for the underwriter to purchase an additional 2 million shares of GOED stock and/or 2 million warrants.

There is a possibility of a bounce back ill grant them that, but dilution doesn't mean it's currently over shorted.  I have no position, and find it odd that this stock has been mentioned 2 or 3x in 24 hours when I hadn't ever heard of it here before.
