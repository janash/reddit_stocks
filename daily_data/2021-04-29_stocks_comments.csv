UFC has a big problem with paying their fighters so they lose lots of talent to Bellator, Pride, One FC, etc. The Reebok deal fucked over fighters' sponsorship money. It was a measly little cash grab for the company and royally fucked over the talent. The ESPN deal makes things more cumbersome and annoying for fans as you gotta deal with ESPN+ and deal with ESPN personalities and broadcasting style (which is infamously bad and unpopular). Pay-per-views are overpriced and I seriously doubt they're getting any growth out of those numbers. Piracy is a persistent problem which they keep claiming they have a solution for but I don't believe them. Piracy streamers will always be ahead of whatever solution they think they might have.

UFC financed debt to build things like the APEX - which literally saved their margins during the pandemic. They've made all the right moves and even got  PAID to do fight island (actually paid to be there, not the other way around)

Is EDR leveraged??? YUP, way more then the UFC - but you're way off base on the UFC itself.

B2 Digital is an MMA company with holdings including HRMMA, Colosseum Combat, UCL, Pinnacle and Strike Hard - they are all micro-regional promotions and currently traded on OTC.

XFC was also recently revived and listed on OTC. They haven't done much since their return, they did a time-buy on NBC Sports which was a pretty shitty decision IMO.... nothing of note since.

You can also buy shares in Roy Jones Jr Promotions - which airs on UFC Fight Pass. I don't know what type of securities it is classified as - but was def a cash grab (seemed scammy, I passed hard)

After the Kimbo Slice/ Elite XC debacle - the ownership behind that show attempted to make a return to the spotlight as ProElite - which was traded OTC before they went under.

International Fight League ""IPO'd"" but they were OTC and not on a major exchange... they failed too.

ONE is reportedly contemplating a SPAC - i asked Chatri about it and he acknowledged they had approached an investment banking firm to explore the option but would not say anything else. They likely can't pass any real audits so a true IPO is probably out of the question for them.

PFL is on their way to an IPO at some point.. they'll have to do something to keep the Ponzi scheme going. They're still taking on investors left-and-right and had to raise an additional $65mil just to do this season.. all of those shareholders are going to look for a return or liquidation event some day.

122,HUGE," As a pharmacist, nice work here. You summed up a few hours of lecture into a digestible read. 

I think one of the other comments hinted here that your numbers are a bit liberal in that it‚Äôs probably even less that make it to market and many of them are not truly new classes or mechanisms of action. Most drugs these days are combo drugs or old drug + new drug. That doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt all good. 

Monoclonal antibodies and small molecule drugs have revolutionized the pharma world and those are the exciting drugs coming out. Their application in cancer, immune disorders, and even high cholesterol is amazing. 

My point is that we have seen some great leaps in medicine in the past decade with those medications and now mRNA vaccines but picking one company that is going to let you retire early is like finding a needle in a haystack. 

In fact, the pharma industry is constantly cannabalizing itself.

125,III," Id love to chip in and add more flavor to the topic. 
Another thing to consider is the fact that one single drug could be working for multiple indications. This could mean anything from expanding to include a larger group of patients within a disease area, to a different and completely unrelated disease. Remember that one disease is still very heterogenic, it comes with variation in terms of severity or specific disease sub groups. All of them require proper documentation of effect. The documentation requirement, how far back to scratch you need to start over, depends on how far away a new indication is from a currently approved one. So new disease area probably phase I-II, but a related one, Phase ii or even just straight to phase III. The reason is that previous phases can document for a wider indication potential. So one example of a drug with wide application is anti-TNF, which by now, probably works for anything that a corticosteroid would do. Difference in terms of side effects is nuking your own body to sugical precision missile strike. And yes anti TNFs are becoming inferior to even more precise medicines. However, sometimes better precision could mean less potential for wide application. But not always.",broccolee,1,/r/stocks/comments/n13hwg/basic_overview_of_the_fda_drug_approval_process/gwayjuy/,0.039,0.894,0.067,0.7184

It's turned into a cesspool of cheap knockoffs, paid fake reviews or fly by night overseas companies. Most of the product photos are extremely bad photoshops of the supposed product placed in weird settings. 

Trying to find legitimate products with actual ratings that haven't been messed with is almost impossible.

It's sad because I used to buy pretty regularly from Amazon and always had good quality products.  Now it's just a gamble on if what you're buying is even remotely what's advertised.  

Hopefully they have some way of getting this stuff under control.",turkeychicken,14,/r/stocks/comments/n1czad/amazon_smashed_earnings_expectations/gwccc5c/,0.129,0.736,0.135,-0.0418

131,AMZN," Amazon used to be a decent site for researching and finding products, but it's not anymore. It's only useful if you already know exactly what you want - the exact brand and model. For example, back in the day, if I wanted a sleeping bag, Amazon was actually useful for researching what's available and finding one of decent quality for a good price. Now there are 10's of pages of nearly identical sleeping bags from randomly-named companies with thousands of 5-star reviews.

And even when you do know the exact brand and model of what you want, Amazon is either out of stock, the price sucks, or Prime shipping isn't available so there's no point in ordering from Amazon at all.

For a recent example, I've been looking to install a solar power system in a shed on my property. Amazon has tons of solar panels, batteries, etc, but it's all no-name crap or stuff from a company that pays Amazon a ton of money to feature their products. If you read serious reviews of solar power systems, they mention brands that you can rarely find for sale on Amazon. So I ended up ordering from a boutique site and they shipped my order just as fast as Amazon would have and I also got free shipping.

Now the only time I order anything from Amazon is if it's something with same-day shipping. Otherwise, there are usually better options for me.

Edit: That being said, since this is an investing forum: I still like AMZN stock. I hold a bunch of it, and I'm up 300% on my original investment.",irresponsible_owl,6,/r/stocks/comments/n1czad/amazon_smashed_earnings_expectations/gwcggej/,0.039,0.799,0.162,0.984

133,AMZN," Multiple reasons.  Retail activity can be supportive to stock price.  

Secondly, the stock *must* be split if AMZN wants to become part of certain indexes, and those indexes tend to drive enormous institutional acquisition.  

Third, making the share price lower drives the volume number, and some of those markets who would drive sentiment and liquidity reward companies with lower price/higher share count volume.

Fourth, I think you're mistaken that a price rise would be ""immaterial and fleeting"".  The same prediction has famously been wrong over and over with numerous big name peers. 

 It also wouldn't ""make it impractical to buy back"".

384,PT," I like F, I scooped up as much as I can. Among the big 3, I think F actually has a bright future in the combination of EV and legacy cars.

EV-wise, Mach-E is sold out everywhere and it is a success in every regards. Once they implement the EV power train in their other platforms, say F-150, Ranger, Bronco, Escape, Explorer, Transit, and all of these are not out of stretch, they have all been planned.

Pickup/SUV: Bronco/Bronco Sport is selling like a hot cake. F-150 is still the dominant pickup in the US, Ranger has success everywhere else where mid-size pickup is popular. Commercial trucks and vans fleet sales are still good. Also remember F  has shares in Rivian too.

GM's EV success primarily came from their ""budget"" Bolt but without the incentive, they are hard to grow, and FCA (or Stelantis) just do not have a lot of footprint in EV.

My PT for F is $15 by EOY, and $20 up once the whole overblown chip shortage is gone.",kirinoke,12,/r/stocks/comments/n14t2y/what_do_people_have_against_ford/gwar80f/,0.039,0.851,0.11,0.8193

Intel announced with its recent ER they are putting a hold on buy backs, dividend will remain and they hope to grow it. Their reasoning was to use the money for R&D, fair, but I also see it as a a strategic move, putting buy backs on hold means when Biden hands them a big check, there is less scrutiny on the situation. I dont think Biden and his administration want to be associated with handing cash to big businesses that blatantly use it for buy backs and executive salaries, something that happened during Trump, and the Dem's were vocal about the issue.

I think INTC will grow into a boeing-like situation. Public company, sells product all over the world, but its a national asset that is crucial for national defense.

Honestly there‚Äôs an over saturation of licensed producers which makes the industry extremely competitive in terms of product pricing. Companies are slashing prices even though the margins on either sourcing or producing the products makes it hard to be positive. The government is also very strict on marketing as right now you can‚Äôt have commercials for cannabis on tv. Obviously there will be some big winners in the industry but right now it‚Äôs not very clear who those winners will be IMO.

Revenue |    
   | Cost of Revenue
Gross Profit |    
   | Operating Costs
Operating Income |  
Income Before Income Taxes |

**Balance Sheet:**


* Total Current Assets
* Total Assets
* Total Current Liabilities
* Total Liabilities
* Total Stockholder's Equity
* Noncontrolling Interest


**Cash Flow Statement:**


* Operating Activities
* Investing Activities
* Financing Activities


These are a ""skeleton"" because all companies (except Financials and REITs so far as I've come across) will have these. They might be under a different name, but they're there.


**With these terms,** you can do a whole lot of visualization and graphing, and get a good understanding of the basic financial position of the company.


**Beyond these terms,** there's a whole lot more in a financial statement that can answer questions you might have about the data. The nature and terms of their debt, the type of assets they hold, preferred or common shares. More and more detail.


**Outside of the financial statement,** the 10-ks and 10-qs can explain more complex scenarios or present those 'future-looking statements'. I do not read every one, but it's good to skim through the most recent. They also explain mergers/acquisitions, special dividends, splits.


There are always more opinions than people, but I'm fairly confident in saying that the above are ""basics"". I look at lots and lots of skeletons and hardly ever look beyond that.

I have a big stack in HUYA and this merger failing would most likely be extremely bad news for both companies short term.

A merger would resolve this, if there's no merger they will keep on outbidding each other until one or both of them go down the shitter. It would likely be Douyu, that's also the explanation of the arbitrage to the 0.7 conversion rate.

490,TFSA," 19 years old and you're able to max out your TFSA and make RRSP contributions?  Well done young sir.

Make sure you put any US dividend stocks in your RRSP, that's the only way to protect them from the 30% withholding tax.

Since you have to worry about capital gains taxes in non-registered accounts, focus your long-term holds there.  That's where you want to put stuff that you just put away and forget about.  TFSA is good for risks and potential multi-baggers that you might want to sell to use the money for lifestyle stuff because you won't get hit by the tax man.",SirGasleak,1,/r/stocks/comments/n15xpq/dividend_portfolio_andor_growth_stocks/gwb0gy6/,0.06,0.812,0.129,0.7184
491,TFSA, Thanks man appreciate it. I was thinking using the gains in my TFSA and transferring them out into more long term plays. Ive received some decent gains already. Would you also say it‚Äôs better to focus more on ETFs than single large cap companies like apple Microsoft etc.,marcusiothebarber,1,/r/stocks/comments/n15xpq/dividend_portfolio_andor_growth_stocks/gwb0yob/,0.0,0.689,0.311,0.9438
492,TFSA," It's good to have a balance but when you're young you can afford to take more risk.

Don't transfer money out of your TFSA in to a non-registered account, you lose all the benefits of tax-free growth that way.  If you want to sell something and lock in the profits, keep the money in the account and buy something else.",SirGasleak,2,/r/stocks/comments/n15xpq/dividend_portfolio_andor_growth_stocks/gwb5t02/,0.093,0.711,0.196,0.7514
493,TFSA," Bingo.  The ability to grow investments tax free from a young age is huge for wealth creation.  And if at some point in the future you need a large chunk of cash (say to buy a car or a house down payment), being able to withdraw that cash without paying tax saves you a ton of money.

Also, my advice is to focus on maxing out your TFSA first and only make RRSP deposits when you have extra cash.  The advantage of the RRSP is the tax deduction, which doesn't really matter when you're young and in a low tax bracket.  And the drawbacks of the RRSP are: 1) It's tax sheltered, not tax-free, so you pay taxes on the gains when you retire; and 2) You can't touch the money until you retire.  You can use it to buy your first home but the government will force you to pay it back into your RRSP.

If you have enough cash to do both, that's just fine.  But if you're trying to decide between the two, always choose the TFSA first.  The RRSP becomes very useful when you have a high salary but will be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.  Then you get the benefit of the tax deduction while you're in a high tax bracket, but you'll pay a lower tax rate when you close the account at retirement.

505,AT," Ooooh pick me, pick me! So I just replied to another post that answers this question - it's actually super interesting why this happens.

The IPO process literally CAUSES IPOs to trade much higher than where they price, and there is an instant transfer of value to select institutions....

**TL;DR - Banks make IPO go brrrrr. Hedgies make money. Stock goes down.**

*If you care to learn about the \*flawed\* IPO process... keep reading...*

The first thing a company does when it wants to IPO is go to a bank to be the bookrunner on the deal (sometimes they pick a few bookrunners). Then those banks go around and gauge interest in the stock to see where they should price the shares.

Seems reasonable right? WRONG.

What happens when they go to price shares is they typically have this internal target of a subscription of AT LEAST 97%. That means that of all the institutions and hedge funds they talk to, they are hoping to price the IPO such that 97% of them say that they'd be willing to buy the stock at that price (regardless of valuation, industry anything...). Think HOW LOW you would have to price an IPO for 97% of people to want to buy it at that price (basic supply and demand suggests that is extremely low).

So what ends up happening is that the bank ends up picking their best/favorite clients to receive allocations in the actual IPO that is already priced too low... They fill a book and sell those IPO shares to hedge funds and institutions at this super low price... but then a lot of the time the stock never even trades there because when it opens for open market trading, there is all this pent up demand from oversubscriptions at this super low price.

So the company that IPOs sells their shares at $5/shr for 100mm shares and raises $500mm... but the second the market opens there is such a huge demand for shares at that low of a price that the banks have caused this super distorted supply/demand picture and the stock rips up to $10/shr, $20/shr, $30/shr... and now the company that IPO'ed through the bank only got $500mm when their stock is now worth $1bn++... all that ""wealth creation"" went straight into the hands of hedgies and other shareholders and not to the company.

Then after the buzz wears off ... the stock usually slumps a few hours/days later. Fundamental and market dynamics take over after that, but that is why you're seeing that reaction in your trading simulation - its real. Now actually GETTING IPO allocations is harder than it looks if you're not a hedge fund or have a relationship with a broker, but in practice, this strategy works a lot of the time.

It's actually the reason that companies are choosing to access public markets via a SPAC merger instead of a traditional IPO. There is more price discovery and they can negotiate the terms of the deal.

me personally have nio bias whatsoever.I personally just think that - no matter the market - national products always have advantages in terms of market acceptance, taxes etc.

chinese cars will be the mainstay in china. no matter what TSLA does, they will end up being the luxury variants like european / german cars were (think of Mercedes and BMW).

respected, wanted, but most will still drive something else.

also, latest test results not from europe, US or china blew everything out of the water. But Korea. Hyundais latest reveal was absolutely fantastic.

5 year revenue growth medium-high

5 year free cash flow growth

current assets > current liabilities

P/E and CF/Earnings under 30

Shares outstanding not increasing

Long term debt 

There are many other things you can and should look at, this is just a start to narrow from thousands of companies down to a few.

It's important you understand the industry and how the company makes money.

Again, this is just a start.

Youtube is another great place to find good stocks to invest in, but again ALWAYS do your own research.

I found out about TTCF from Meet Kevin (amazing content creator) and Financial Education (extremely basic videos imo, most of his content I find to be low quality) so both youtubers. I watched their videos on the company, I liked their key points that they pointed out and I liked the industry so I began doing my own research and from my own research I came to the conclusion that I think the company will perform very, very well in the future, so I invested. I never invested solely based off of the content from the youtube videos, but it did help me find a new interesting stock. 

Another idea is to just search up a specific industry and google to find out all of the major publicly traded companies in that space, then look into them.

The need to be bought out by a big company. Simple as that. Someone who is already deep into healthcare enterprise who can simply slip their service to their current clients as added value.

For specialized emergent healthcare decisions, yea to an extent -somewhere remote- can buzz an interventional neurologist to help guide stroke management during an hours-long transfer to a primary center.  For a remote SF medic doing weird crap downrange, telemedicine brings awesome knowledge to the front.

Currently our system is doing 99% of consultations by phone.  Nobody is happy with that as a patient and wants in person.  I do know several people have died because bad stuff was missed, because telemedicine.  Middle aged white men tend to get stereotypical ‚Äúcrushing chest pain‚Äù heart attacks.

First I'll ask, why did you get into the stock? Has the investment thesis changed for you? Management is guiding almost 100% increase in revenue year over year ($1.09 million in 2020 vs $1,970 million to $2,020 million in 2021). The net loss that you're citing (-1.31/share) includes a stock based compensation expense of 0.57/share as the Livongo merger continues to vest. As I look through this thread I see a lot of references to Amazon taking market share and 'lack of a moat', 'anyone can do what TDOC does' etc. I addressed these concerns in the r/stocks earnings thread so I will copy/paste that here:

This is the investment thesis as I understand it - their technology (in terms of interview software) isn't their moat. Any hospital system can do what they do with zoom/skype/whatever. Their moat is actually in the sheer number of doctors on their network (55,000 physicians in over 450 subspecialties) and in their first mover advantage (over 40% of the fortune 500 are clients). Their first mover advantage gives them a large client base which entices physicians to their platform and employers are also then likely to go with the platform that provides their employees with the greatest/most diverse access to care.

I would be remiss if I didn't mention government acknowledgement here. 94% of Medicare advantage plans have said that they will offer telehealth benefits in 2021 vs 58% in 2020. TDOC currently has over 2.5 million Medicare advantage members. The pandemic lowered barriers such as CMS now allowing physicians the same rate of reimbursement for telehealth visits as they do for in person visits and CMS requirement not allowing patients to see providers without an existing relationship was removed.

Yes local hospital clinics could do this at a small scale but think about availability of staff and rural communities which currently do not have access to many of the subspecialties that TDOC can provide. 

I am most excited about their Livongo acquisition and the synergies it provides with their current service offerings for holistic care/remote monitoring. That, imo, is the driver of their next leg of profitability. AI data analytics can significantly reduce medical costs, especially with chronic disease care management. This is something businesses and healthcare companies have a large vested interest in",PM_ME_DANK,0,/r/stocks/comments/n10zmq/what_to_do_with_tdoc/gwblvbl/,0.012,0.901,0.088,0.9737
