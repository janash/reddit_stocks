Averaging down only pans out when it eventually rises back up and you're tying up more of your buying power to do so which is a problem if the overall market keeps slapping ya down. The only things I've averaged down as of late are stuff that have clear catalysts like ZOM and TRCH that I can bank on to hopefully give me the upside I need to exit gracefully.

120,OCGN," You need to have options enabled on your Robinhood account.

When you pull up the stock and hit ""trade"", in addition to buy and sell you'll see ""trade options"".

From there pick a date and a strike price above the current share price.  For example, as I'm typing this Ocgn has an April 16 $10 call at $0.55.

If you sell this call, you commit to sell 100 shares of OCGN to the buyer for $10/share if the market price goes over $10.  In exchange for this you receive $0.55/share ( $55 for your 100 shares) up front.  

If the price doesn't get to $10 by then, you keep your shares and the $55.  If it does go over $10, you'd sell your shares for $10*100= $1000 + you still have the $55.  

The negatives are that you can't sell those shares during that time, and if OCGN blew up to $22, you still have to sell at $10.",rage-fest,4,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/mdtnmq/well_thats_the_last_straw_setting_my_limit_sells/gsbr0m9/,0.009,0.91,0.081,0.8658
