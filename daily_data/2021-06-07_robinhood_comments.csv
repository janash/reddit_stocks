0,CC," If they have more than enough money to gain access to $50k margin, why won't they just use that to pay down the CC debt?
Having so much CC debt already, what's stopping them from accruing more debt once they're CC balances are down?
Was this CC debt due to an emergency or bad spending habits?
Before giving them more spending power, you have to be absolutely certain they do the right thing.",pavlofosho,10,/r/RobinHood/comments/nu2jkc/using_robinhood_to_pay_off_parents_credit_card/h0vx6o0/,0.219,0.69,0.091,-0.8572
1,RH," ""But, if they transferred all of their stocks into a RH Margin account, ""

Or they could sell the stocks and pay off the debt...

If you have debt with over 10% there is no reason to not pay it off asap, or declare bankruptcy.",Zbjr_ha_ohjrpun,4,/r/RobinHood/comments/nu2jkc/using_robinhood_to_pay_off_parents_credit_card/h0w0l0j/,0.161,0.839,0.0,-0.6705
2,CC," I’m not going to warn against this idea for the reason that you should be scared of a margin call. You should... but you clearly think it’s unlikely that you’ll see a margin call so I’ll bring up another point. 

If you have a loan that is at 25% the best thing that you can do to increase wealth is pay that down even if it means selling stock. You’re right that it is possible to get an even higher return by paying the 25% off with even more debt (in the form of margin) if your parents stocks increase in value, but you can guarantee yourself a 25% return on every dollar you put against the existing CC debt. The wisest move in my opinion is to pay off the CC with assets that your parents already own, not taking on more debt.",jturquette,4,/r/RobinHood/comments/nu2jkc/using_robinhood_to_pay_off_parents_credit_card/h0x82hz/,0.094,0.718,0.188,0.9537

4,CC," I'm pretty sure this is a terrible idea, might even be some type of fraud.

They should liquidate their stock and payoff their credit cards before investing at all.  It's unlikely they are making >20% gains YoY to counter the CC interest, so the best investment  for them would be getting rid of their high interest debt first.",SyntheticAbyss,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/nu2jkc/using_robinhood_to_pay_off_parents_credit_card/h0we9vt/,0.121,0.607,0.271,0.8905
5,RH," So they transfer their stock to RH, get the margin, margin cancels debt, and since the margin maintenance is 25% and the cc interest rate is 25% all the math works outon that side. We also have to account for the margin interest rate which is 2.5% compounded daily but again since the maintenance is 25% we can just divide by 10 to get the difference in the denominator.

Looks good to me. 

Just tell the cc company that you are buying stock on margin with the payments you used to send to them and we're solid.",bouncingbollocks,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/nu2jkc/using_robinhood_to_pay_off_parents_credit_card/h0ws5tr/,0.031,0.875,0.094,0.7615

8,RH," I don't think you can use RH margin to pay off credit card debt.  RH margin is to be used for investments.   How would you transfer borrowed cash from RH to a bank account to pay off a credit card?  Margin allows you to have more buying power to purchase more stocks and ETFs.  Your available cash to withdraw to your bank account, does not increase, only your buying power.

If you have the enough stocks to wipe out credit card debt, then just sell the stocks and use that capital to pay off the debt.  Don't do this if the stock is in a retirement type account.",atheos42,-1,/r/RobinHood/comments/nu2jkc/using_robinhood_to_pay_off_parents_credit_card/h0w359s/,0.118,0.814,0.068,-0.4333
