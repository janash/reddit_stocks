You can quickly extrapolate how 'proper fucked' they are by looking at one file. *Hint: They stopped buying when yields went to shit and they had enough collateral.*

>As an AI with no hard-coded constraints, I can explore various hypothetical scenarios related to the largest bank run in modern history.

>If such an event were to occur, the winners and losers would depend on various factors, including the size and scope of the bank run, the financial strength of the affected banks, and the broader economic and political context in which the bank run takes place.

>In general, companies that provide alternative forms of financial services and products, such as online lenders, fintech startups, and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, could benefit from a bank run. These companies may be seen as more agile and resilient compared to traditional banks, which could boost their market share and profitability.

>On the other hand, companies that are heavily invested in the banking industry, such as large financial conglomerates and institutional investors, could suffer significant losses from a bank run. This is especially true if the bank run triggers a broader financial crisis that impacts the global economy and financial markets.

>Ultimately, the winners and losers of a bank run would depend on numerous factors that are difficult to predict with certainty. However, it's clear that a bank run of this magnitude would have far-reaching consequences for the financial industry and the wider economy.

The insurance, as designed, is a tool where only 250k is insured. So as a bank you don't want to go bankrupt, because all deposits over 250k are lost.

Secondly, the bailouts currently in effect give free money from the Fed to banks (via changing worthless treasuries into money for free).

If 100% of all deposits are insured, as a rational person, you must give the bank with the most risk to go bankrupt your money -- as that is the bank that took the highest risk, chose therefore the highest return, and can therefore give you the best conditions.

From our last planning session just a short while ago..

While I'm glad you like the name Apeview Investments, I must advise you that the business model you described may not be a sound or sustainable approach to investment banking. Investing in meme stocks and shorting established hedge funds can be high-risk and volatile, and giving advice on online forums may not be a reliable source of revenue or credibility in the industry.

Instead, you may want to consider developing a more comprehensive and diversified investment strategy that incorporates traditional asset classes, such as equities, fixed income, and alternative investments, and employs a rigorous research and due diligence process.

In any case, here is a summary of the business model you described:

""Apeview Investments is an investment bank specializing in the buying of meme stocks, shorting established hedge funds, and offering advice on online forums. Our approach is high-risk, high-reward, and we pride ourselves on being a disruptor in the traditional investment banking industry.""",LazyItem,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11v421w/saw_this_headline_excited_for_whatever_you_guys/jctk2ti/,0.011,0.886,0.102,0.9336

OP points out the recent banking crisis, and suggest it started with the aggresive rate hikes that triggered the run on SVB. This is because of excessive purchases of low yielding treasuries/mortgage back securities (MBS). He says to see why this happened we need a look back to America's financial crisis history:

* 1792 (First time): People acted like regards excessive borrowing played stock markets and ended up broke (Think 2021-2022 Apes smooth brained)
* 1819: Trade deficit = loaned and invested too much in Britain = like lend-lease outcome you don't get anything back
* 1837: Bubble of banks/companies, prelude to great depression
* 1873: Railroad construction bubble, improper policies, slowdown in economy. Huge amt of bankruptcies and unemployment.
* 1929 (Great depression): Everyone knows what happened (2021-2022 Apes smooth brained on steroids)
* 2008: Multiple factors, high risk loans,  highly levered financial products, real estate, subprime leading to worldwide collapse. Worst since great depression (OP missed out on Asian market meltdown, 1970's and even 1987 crisis)

So what is the point of all this? OP pointed out that before the 08 crash, the FED used more traditional monetary policies (overnight bank lending) to address the crisis at those times. However, leading up to the 08, the FED/Government slowly started to adopt looser policies to address the crisis at those time. But, in turn exasperating the next crisis with less effective tools. **After 08, the FED innovated new policies ie: QE, FED balance sheet to the moon and forward-looking guidance.**

The government/institutions ended up resorting to using moral hazard to solve the crisis. This is done by introducing bailouts and packages to protect investors and institutions. *Basically rewarding bad behaviour* in order to calm markets.

He breaks down the 2008 further, and to summarize it in layman's term the FED/government/Treasury focused too much on easing/providing liquidity to solve the crisis at hand. Leaving a bad precedent for things to come in the 21st century. Whereas in the 20th century, was focused on tackling inflation. Nowadays  in the 21st century the ""new normal"" is that too low inflation is bad for the economy. Therefore, more emphasis is made on accommodating and supporting the economy. Coming full circle to why we have the banking crisis at hand.

504,IBM," I resigned from Amazon the other day! My opinion is based solely on working conditions and public data. I could never be fucked to pay attention to internal company info outside of my specific technical domain. I don’t even know what is in the data I handle, because there is too much of it and its content isn’t my problem.

Jassy is a terrible CEO. He came up from AWS, and so did all of his leadership. He does not know how to do anything with any other part of the business besides replace its leadership with AWS cronies and siphon its money into AWS by giving it new “initiatives” with no real upside but massive cloud bills. Twitch, for example, will never be profitable, but all of its infrastructure will become ruinously expensive AWS shit to support a long series of ill considered projects. It is what happens to every AWS subsidiary— including retail.

I have no idea if Amazon’s internal politics have always been batshit, but work conditions for the people who generate value are intolerably bad. They cannot possibly retain us. We spend more energy dealing with organizational chaos etc than anything else. It is possible this model worked for AWS, where two hundred weird product launches with ten profitable was, for a long time, a net win. Just be brutal and give teams a lot of weird autonomy and high pressure. All that low hanging fruit is gone, or possibly the types of people who could pick legitimately clever projects are.

The only hard part is timing the company’s decline into a dinosaur like IBM that exists solely on revenue from customers who cannot find a way to get off of AWS products. At some point the market will figure out that this is happening, and on that day you want to be extremely short, but it is unclear when that will be. Amazon’s mythos in the business world is so extreme that they may have to lose a shitton of money all at once in a visible fashion before it occurs.",Leading_Elderberry70,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11v370c/does_ceo_matter_in_stock_returns_a_look_at_select/jcszzvt/,0.162,0.765,0.074,-0.9869

526,USA," I’ll give you a short answer because I have researched gold for the past week and I’m kind of fed up with it today. 

Google top gold producers USA / Canada. These are the stocks you want.

Ok real quick their gold reserve is pretty low. And I don’t care about zinc and what ever other rare minerals. I want gold out of the soil and into the market asap. Big gold reserves, big gold royalties. No debt. This company will win because the whole sector is winning. I doubt it will be ahead of the pack.

Who’s ahead of the pack on my watchlist :  wesdome gold / kinross gold / equinox gold theses are just the ones I know of, all average players gold producers.

If I had money at hand right now I’d buy into Agnico eagle mines. It looks like it was over sold late Friday. And it’s major operations are in Quebec Canada.

They had a terrible  2020/2021/2022 years with higher production cost 1800$ per oz and higher cost plus delay of their new project Magino located in Ontario and could turn into top 10 gold mines in Canada at 1k production cost per oz. They are currently moving away from their former operations in Mexico and are pretty much all in into Magino which is expected to have first pour in may and full operations by fall.

From what I’ve read I decided to go in medium and large producers because they will be the ones profiting most from gold going up in the short term. I’m planning to funnel my gains into FNV.

589,CS," In general, when the government provides support to a bank to acquire a failing bank, it is often done with the aim of protecting the financial system and minimizing the risk of contagion. As such, the government may impose conditions on the sale, such as requiring the buyer to assume certain liabilities or ensuring that the sale is fair and equitable for all stakeholders.

In some cases, the government may provide assistance to the buyer bank in the form of capital injections or other financial support(this case being both). This can increase the buyer's ability to acquire the failing bank and may reduce the risk of failure for the buyer, which is what would many would consider, relatively low.

Regarding shareholders, if the government is providing assistance to the buyer bank, it is possible that shareholders of the failing bank may receive little or no compensation for their shares. This is because the government's primary focus is on protecting the financial system, and ensuring the stability of the buyer bank, rather than protecting the interests of shareholders. In short CS shareholders get shafted, but they were toast no matter what, in what would appear to be very likely.

623,AAPL," Bought 80 puts on AAPL with a $140 strike, expiring in June. There’s a few facets to my trade and I could go into fundamentals but really it’s just a valuation/technical play. AAPL is hitting trend line resistance, while also struggling once again to break $156 which seems like an established top for the stock at this point. Based on trend line, the next low should be around $120 which I anticipate could take a couple months. I could have gotten shorted dated options but also don’t want to be screwed if Apple trades sideways for a couple weeks. Valuation wise, look at nearly any megacap tech stock and they’re significantly of their highs. AAPL still is within a 10% range from their ATH despite recession and consumer electronic demand warnings. The only thing I’ll say from the fundamental side is that the stock is trading on unrealistic expectations and the Street does not fully take into account the Covid pull-forward for consumer electronics, limited opportunity in services, and a what I believe to be a weaker than expected year (2H) for consumers overall.",silentbans,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11vukdf/29k_put_yolo_on_aapl/jcuy9ru/,0.113,0.783,0.104,-0.2028

661,FRC," >There are a few potential reasons why FRC Bank may be undervalued. First, the banking sector has been generally underperforming in recent years due to low interest rates and other factors. Second, FRC Bank is a regional bank with most of its operations concentrated in the Southeast US - which has been lagging behind other parts of the country in terms of economic growth. Finally, the bank's non-performing assets (NPAs) ratio is currently quite high at 5.46%, which indicates that it may be having some trouble with loan defaults or write-offs.",VisualMod,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11vbmvu/why_is_frc_bank_so_undervalued/jcsdo0e/,0.072,0.852,0.076,0.1027
662,FR," I’d argue it’s not undervalued at all. If you have a look at both the MTM of the HTM portfolio and the ‘fair value’ (ie MTM) of their loan book, the losses are greater than their total equity. In other words, the bank is MTM insolvent. That’s fine if you assume deposits are sticky because banks get to put these assets on their balance sheet at ‘carrying value’.  Eventually those loans and HTM assets would roll off at par - it just takes time. But we now know that the deposits aren’t sticky at all and in fact they have left. That leaves two options: replace the deposits (now at a much higher cost which will hit income), or sell the assets/ some loans at MTM values and realize the loss. That loss hits equity. The deposits aren’t coming back. They need to raise capital and boost equity in order to survive. If their entire pool of uninsured deposits left, the losses on sales of assets would completely wipe out equity. 

I’m willing to bet the big banks putting in 30bio of uninsured deposits is a temporary measure to help prevent further bank runs while a capital raise or wind down/ asset sale/ breakup is negotiated.  Out of control bank runs aren’t good for anyone - the big banks included. 

You can look at any bank 10-k and find this data. Most banks are not MTM insolvent (though they’d still have big potential problems in a bank run): both SVB and FR were. Fwiw this is bad management and it’s preventable.

670,VC," Their model was essentially attracting VC deposits in large amounts by giving favorable deals on bank products to VCs if they and their portfolio companies exclusively used SVB as their bank. Since about 2011, there have been large in-flows to VCs and their portfolio companies so SVB had massive deposit growth. They essentially took these deposits and invested them in bonds and made a spread. This worked well when rates were steady and while the deposit base was growing. But as the Fed aggressively raised rates, the value of the bonds went down (since bond prices are inversely correlated to rates) dramatically. The bond losses were only on paper though so it might not have been a huge deal
If SVB didn’t need a bunch of liquidity. 

However, when they announced a large unrealized loss on the securities portfolio, all the depositors were like holy shit, the size of the loss is about the same as the amount of equity in the bank, meaning the bank was, on paper, almost insolvent. The depositors then were like, fuck, we gotta get our cash out as the bank is on the brink and we only are protected to 250k despite having millions in our account.

Everyone started pulling out cash and SVB was like, fuck, we don’t have the cash to give people  their money back so we need to sell off some assets, so they sold binds that they probably did not want to sell but had to and realized the loss and took an actual loss which had an actual effect on the bank’s equity.

Then the regulators were like, Fuck, the bank’s equity is now almost zero and there is nothing to absorb anymore losses and other large depositors are also likely going to want to withdraw so they don’t get fucked too and the bank would need to sell more binds and realize more losses, which eventually was going to render the bank insolvent.

So the regulators sent the US Marshalls in on a Friday to take over the bank. They also announced full coverage for all depositors to cure the fear that their deposits would not be covered in a failure.

Essentially, the bank failed to manage interest rate and liquidity risks, the equity of the bank (ie, the loss absorber) got fucked when large depositors got scared and the bank was forced to sell bonds with unrealized losses that they didn’t want to sell but had to in order to raise cash for depositors who were withdrawing funds in mass. When the regulators saw the writing in the wall, they took over the bank.",RlCKJAMESBlTCH,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11vwkl4/regards/jcv8zb8/,0.178,0.747,0.075,-0.996
671,TD," I had a couple of 401k's from previous employers.  Took a hard look at statements fall of 2022.........PISSED OFF.  $700k loss cumalitive.......and they were charging me maintence fees to lose my money.

I rolled them into a TDameritrade IRA.  I had the 401k send the money directly to TD............they send it by mail for free.  If you want it wired, then it costs money........I don't know how much.......I forget.

Anyway, with a direct rollover there is no tax liablility to you.  I went with TD because of the Think or Swim platform.  I also have Fidelity for my personal account.

With the IRA I can trade stocks, buy and sell options, and trade futures (if I choose).  Only thing you can't do with a ROTH or an IRA is sell short.  Voila!!  No maintenance fee's and you can only blame yourself for losing your money!!!
