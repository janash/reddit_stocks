But yeah, if governments have to guarantee all banks at all times to protect deposits, why whould you allow banks to make high risk moves and pay bonusses to shareholders and employees when they succeed, only to have taxpayers make up the difference when it all fails.

Ok technically Credit Suisse is not a bailout and shareholders lose a lot, but she Swiss gov *would have* bought Credit Suisse had UBS refused.

The only thing I have today is a position in NCMGF, an Australian miner being bought out by Newmont. Cheap shares that act as a leveraged bet on NEM, which is in turn a leveraged bet on gold. Needless to say, not a big piece of my portfolio, just there as a minor hedge, one among many.

48,BAC," I like and own SOFI. I don't buy into the 'future of banking' bullshit surrounding it, but I think they will do well going forward simply because a large portion of their loans are newer and therefore at higher rates than other banks (lucky timing more than anything). They're also one of the few banks whose deposits have increased over the last year, which means they shouldn't have the same liquidity issues that you worry about elsewhere. 

If you're looking for stability/lower risk exposure to banking I'd stick to JPM. BAC, C and WFC are just awful companies, even if their shares might do well I don't think I could convince myself to ever buy them.

84,USA," 

Yes, Ally is the leading auto lender. Followed by Wells Fargo Auto, Chase Auto, Capital One Auto Finance, and Santander Consumer USA

Research shows the automotive industry and their associated lending partners are being hit hard by a tsunami of bad news. Sales are down due to higher interest rates. Loan defaults and repossessions are at historic levels and ever increasing. People who bought new cars during the pandemic at highly inflated prices way above MSRP are defaulting in ever increasing numbers especially as pandemic forbearance periods expire. Auto lender repossessions are flooding their balance sheets with used cars not worth their loan value - they're ""under water"".

Auto lenders are unsuccessfully attempting to auction/sell these ""under water"" repos at large auction houses like Manheim. They're not selling because the bluebook value at auction is below what the bank has invested in the repo. Essentially, the repo isn't worth its current value and the auto lender doesn't want to take the loss. Unfortunately for the auto lender, it's only a matter of time before the auto lender must sell these ""toxic assets"" and take the loss because the market is being flooded by more repossessions everyday. 

What is the best way to profit from this situation?

Some have suggested shorting these stocks.",KerryOnAgain,9,/r/investing/comments/11vbhfs/would_you_guys_buy_any_banks_next_week_to_take/jcth42y/,0.081,0.803,0.116,0.846

I think the big banks are obviously beneficiaries of some of the not well thought out things Yellen has said, basically encouraging moving all deposits over 250k to TBtF banks. So I am looking at a buy in point for FNCL ETF.  
But what is crazy to me is that banks with good balance sheets that were trading at value anyway, because they were boring, got hit hard. I have owned both OPBK and WSBC in the past, and am rereading financial statements to find another buy in point for each.

104,NVDA," Looking for advice on NVDA exit strategy.

So a little background. I bought NVDA stock on a hunch back in September of last year for $143 a share. Since then, it has gone up to $243/sh for a 76% gain on my position.  
  
I would feel happy with exiting here and taking that gain, but I'm a newbie investor so not sure if that's the best plan.  
  
I was hoping y'all could provide some perspective and run me through your thoughts when exiting a position. Are there tax benefits to keeping the stock? How do you know if the stock is at the end of its bull run? Is it feasible to sell the stock now and buy it back when it inevitably dips back down? Are there any contributing factors I'm not knowledgeable enough to know about?

So, banks can choose to hold some investments called ""held-to-maturity"" securities until they mature, which means they're making a commitment to hold on to them for a while. Now, if they want to hedge the interest rate risk associated with those securities (basically, protect themselves from interest rate changes), they're breaking that commitment. This triggers some complicated accounting stuff that can hurt their earnings, and it also messes with the certainty that investors have about the cash flows they'll receive from those securities. So, to keep things simple and transparent, the accounting rules say no direct hedging for held-to-maturity securities.",palance_,2,/r/investing/comments/11vg7fd/daily_general_discussion_and_advice_thread_march/jcv1om3/,0.081,0.699,0.22,0.963

That's fair, but it's also worth remembering the US banking environment is massively unconcentrated.  JPM is the largest at 8% of all US banking assets.  That is far less dominant than banks in other markets, or leading companies in other sectors.  The US banking sector has thousands of tiny banks (often poorly run and supervised).

112,ABC," I will comment once more since a lot of people sort of equate a bank going under and FDIC coverage with a brokerage going under and think SIPC coverage is sort of the same and they would act the same.

Lets talk about commingled assets for a second

Banks commingle assets or cash. If 10,000 all put $100 into the bank, it goes into a big pot. The bank now has 1 million of cash and it then in turn goes out and lends it out to other people . Maybe it buys government bonds  , maybe it does some loans to businesses ect.

Well point being if in a week all 10,000 of us ask for our money back the bank will not have it, it will have bonds, and loans but not cash.  Now as long as the bank is solvent it could then turn around and sell its loans/bonds to others and hopefully come up with 1 million , but if some of the loans are bad, the rates on its bonds are under current rate it may only be able to liquidate for 990k , people might lose money (assuming FDIC insurance doesn't step in)

Now lets look at brokerages ; for the most part brokerages DO NOT COMMINGLE FUNDS; unless they are committing FRAUD.

In this example 10,000 of us all buy $100 of ETF ABC, it trades at $100 a share so the brokerage buys 10,000 shares.

Those shares are not commingled , they sit at the brokerage .  If in a week all 10,000 of us want to sell ABC the brokerage turns around and says ""Ok here they are""; It will have no trouble giving us the 10,000 shares even if we want to all with draw at once. Like wise if a brokerage goes bankrupt well those 10,000 shares of ABC are still sitting at a brokerage , no other creditor can try to claim them.

Its more akin to storing coins or something in a ""safety deposit box"" ; if a bank goes bankrupt it can't start opening safety deposit boxes and pawning them off.

So imagine you have a gold coin in a safety deposit box at a bank; the bank goes bankrupt. Most likely one of two things will happen

1. The bank calls you and says ""Hey you have 60 days to get the stuff from your safety deposit box , come get it because we are shutting down in 60 days""
2. You show up one day and the bank has a new name on the front, but you notice little difference your key still opens your safety deposit box and it still has 1 gold coin in it

SIPC usually gets involved in missing assets , assets usually go missing because of fraud (The bank manager is opening the safety deposit boxes and taking the gold coins out) not just because the brokerage goes bankrupt.

So really its not bankruptcy you have to worry about  , its FRAUD",SirGlass,1,/r/investing/comments/11vtv1c/hypothetical_broker_collapse/jcvf0mu/,0.116,0.763,0.121,-0.8422

115,MF," >went under due to fraud and commingling of funds 

This is the key word, MF global was commiting fraud .

This actually brings up a good point, SIPC usually only has to come in when there is fraud. SIPC protects against missing asset. Assets really only go missing if there is fraud.

A normal brokerage going bankrupt usually has no missing assets (unless they were also committing fraud)

When a brokerage goes understand it's not always committing fraud.

Bear Stearns went under due to bad bets on mortgages. However it wasn't commingling assets , it wasn't committing fraud.

When bear shut down SIPC didn't have to get involved because there was no missing assets .",SirGlass,2,/r/investing/comments/11vtv1c/hypothetical_broker_collapse/jcv6pt1/,0.294,0.58,0.126,-0.9829
