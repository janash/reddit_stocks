0,IQ," Because our government has been bought and paid for by billionaires. These crooks own the government. They steal their billions using illegal and manipulative methods. They then donate to corrupt politicians so that those politicians win(the politicians are good at convincing the public they are the good guy but money and illegal voting also go a long way). Over time you end up with a lot of dumb ass corrupt politicians in power that are easily bribed, and that is what happens. That is what happened. This shit has been going on for 100+ years but probably in the last 60 is when it took off(starting in the 60's and really turning the corner in the 70's).  Drugs, hookers, mansions, trips, etc... all used to entice these politicians(remember that either they were already rich or somewhat poor so either they already played the game or were easily swayed buy the riches). The problems started stacking up bigger and bigger. And now we are here....

The government isn't going to fix itself, it can't, how could it? It's like asking a child to build the space shuttle. It can't even if it wanted to. It doesn't know how.  Most politicians are literally morons(Avg IQ < 100, ok, I know a moron is technically like < 70 but in some sense many of them are when you include modern advancements like the internet and society). They never actually learn any real world skills that enable them to truly government an advanced society in a positive way(They might learn the political game and have to be two faced but they don't learn about psychology, mathematics, science, etc). Of course they all think they are geniuses because they won their election... but they just go on to fuck shit up. Take any politician you can find, NONE of them are qualified! NONE! There are people out there that are truly intelligent and could make a real difference. 10x more intelligent than all the politicians combined. But if they ran they would not win since the billionaires would see them as a threat and throw as much money as needed to stop them(they know they can get the money back easily so it's not a big deal, it's not a waste but an investment).

This is the kind of shit that happens. The slaves don't think about this shit because they generally are too busy working and just trying to survive and have been manipulated to waste their lives on meaningless shit(i.e., they are dumbed down intentionally).  Notice how hard it is to get any criminal politician, cop, bureaucrat, billionaire, or anyone part of the system to be held accountable even in the minorist of ways. Even things that used to be logical such as: If someone steals money they have to pay back more and go to jail. Now that only applies the slaves.

What happens if that when you end up with a group of people that work together there is a distillation and concentration of the core mentalities. This is how cults are formed. ""Dissidents"" are kicked out/excluded/ostracized/belittled/etc. Over time all organizations turn in to cults because of this. This is ""crystallization"" and it's the same thing that happens with crystal formation(Because the same abstract dynamical processes are at play) and many other natural phenomena. It's not a bad thing except cults generally are just an echo chamber and any contradictions/falsehoods that show up by the leaders can't be challenged by the followers(since leaders do not want to be challenged nor lose their position(rather it being about who can actually best lead)). So, we have these very basic problems that cause major issues in societies and our governments are the biggest manipulators of society... and they have these problems but no politician is intelligent enough to understand them but even if a few were, they would be ignored by the ignore morons. 

&#x200B;

It's just the way it is. As humanity gets more intelligent it will try to shed off the ignorance of the past... that is what is happening now. It is a very slow and sometimes very unstable process. IF humanity lasts and has no major negative setbacks(like nuclear war, biowar, etc) then it will eventually figure this shit out(a lot of it is already known/discovered but it just hasn't been absorbed in to the ""DNA"" of humanity yet). Most people have an intuitive sense when things are wrong but no intellectual sense, this makes them less effective at creating proper change but they generally do go in the right direction given enough time(sorta like a biased random walk).

For example, If someone suggests that our politicians need to be intelligence tested, show a wide variety of knowledge and experiences, force their policies to be stress tested, and have restrictive limits put on them, no one wants all that. No one really wants to require politicians to be properly educated. The morons do this to themselves. They want their cake and eat it too. The morons want to remain morons(go party, fuck, have fun, drink, fuck some more, have kids, get rich doing nothing, fuck some more) and they want their politicians to be like them. Socrates and Plato new over 2500's ago the kinds of things needed, yet man kind still hasn't learned these basic principles(because the morons refuse to educate themselves because fucking is easier and more fun).  For those people that want a better work and try themselves to do better, they unfortunately are stuck in a world dictated by the masses. This is why education should be the #1 focus by humanity. All our energies should be pored in to it. Free education for all. Only shelter, energy, and food come first. Educate the masses of morons(pay them to get educated and make it a life long process) and things will start to change drastically. Almost all the problems man today have been analyzed for millennia by millions of humans. The answers are more or less out there, but it requires the masses to at least learn about the questions first.",EternalDissonance,8,/r/stocks/comments/m9z8ai/hedge_fund_manager_steve_cohen_who_bailed_out/grq6sm1/,0.155,0.721,0.125,-0.989

139,SQ," You are right to pay attention to the market cap and not the price. Market cap is the number of shares times the price. The company can decide how many shares they want to divide themselves into. So using small simple numbers, whether they are 10 shares at $50 each or 100 shares at $5 each it’s the same company value. In this case the market values Square at 3X PayPal meaning they would expect either the current or potential future income to FAR exceed PayPal. For that reason I’m not sure whether SQ is really at a good price. And I agree with your thoughts too that SQ will probably follow the value of BTC because they invested so heavily in it. I do think SQ will bounce back really well short term, and they are the future of digital payments so their long term value should be good, but expect lots of waves and long flat times. While not as overvalued as Tesla I think we have seen what can happen quickly to an overvalued company. 

Personally I have SQ, PayPal, and Citibank in my portfolio. PayPal was the slowest to grow last year but between their online presence and Venmo payment system I believe them to be a solid company.",trail34,2,/r/stocks/comments/m9rq6n/what_do_you_think_about_buying_into_square_on/grp8c6d/,0.012,0.874,0.114,0.9168
140,DD," Maybe because Miami and Tampa are more like the Northeast? Not sure. It’s data I saw in an article some months back. I don’t recall where Florida fell, but guessing that’s more in the Venmo arena. I’m in in the Northeast and agree almost everyone uses Venmo or PayPal, but I don’t deny that Cashapp is bigger elsewhere (and see the use of Square in many small businesses and restaurants. Went to a brewery a couple nights ago, was using Square for contactless service).

Edit: best I could do so far. An ark investments DD comparing Venmo, cashapp, and others. Definitely Venmo used more, but cashapp growing and catching Venmo while Venmo showing stagnation.

144,FSD," Tesla’s ride hailing model (if deployed) is way more scalable and profitable than what Uber and Lyft is doing now.. that said I still have doubt on whether they can pull it off. The issue is with the self driving tech. There are scenarios where FSD outperform human drivers, but there are edge cases where human drivers can easily navigate through. If accidents happen because FSD cannot handle the edge cases, it will lose some trust among users. 

Also there is the risk of Tesla hitting supply chain limits (e.g. batteries, chips), but then that’s a problem for the whole industry and Tesla will still be the leader.",No_Low_2541,22,/r/stocks/comments/m9zkxi/ark_invest_price_target_wtf/grpndpd/,0.118,0.803,0.079,-0.5884

I believe they also assumed 60% of tesla owners would lend their car out for autonomous taxi services. 60% is ridiculous imo, I reckon its more towards 10%.

146,FSD," I thought so a year ago. Then I saw how far european governments have come in terms of EV-infrastructure and regulatory framework for full self-driving (FSD). Then I figured it would all happen way faster than I expected, because europe is really far behind on all of this, nevertheless they have put up quite some efforts lately and I presume if europe does okay on all these things, the U.S. must do great and china is going to completely crush it. I was highly sceptical of the whole FSD thing but now I am not anymore. Also the margins on insurance, FSD ride-hailing and so, I mean these margins are not remotely comparible to that of theconventional ride-hailing and insurance industries. I think it may turn out to be even better than expected. Even though I agree the TAM purely for selling Tesla EVs may be too optimistic. I dont really like them selling cars, its pretty useless because margins are mediocre compared to what they could do, e.g. tokenize the cars and build a network of FSD vehicles that do everything from transportation of goods to ride-hailing for people etc. There are a couple of start-ups that actually buy Teslas, tokenize them on the ethereum blockchain and people can invest into the cars to get a share of the profit the cars make. I hope Elon has the balls to do it. Wouldn't even mind the stock to crash 50% cuz people dont get what's really happening. Good buying opportunity then. But lets see what happens.

Mining their own Lith, creating a cheaper and longer lasting battery. Not dependant on China for Cobolt which is what drove them to create the new battery.

181,FCF," Microsoft, Sony, Dell, Adobe.

Microsoft. They have an enormous moat. Their current price is reasonable. Azure is well positioned for growth.

Sony. because it's still one of the most undervalued large cap stocks out there. If you're looking for value this one should grab your attention. They have very diviersified revenue streams and a great management team. It's kind of like buying a micro ETF.

Dell. Market leader in multi-cloud solutions. So they also have a big moat. Good value stock & great management. Like with Sony, until recently the market was significantly undervaluing them imho (has been somewhat corrected in the past 2 months).

Not a fan of Netflix and Amazon at all **at their current prices**. For Amazon first of all their stock is very expensive right now (as in high P/E, P/FCF and EV/EBITDA). Their business prospects have to extremely good to be worth it imho which is just not the case: competition is extremely heated in ecommerce and they're failing to get marketshare everywhere outside the USA. They're very dependent on the saturated US market.

182,USA," Microsoft, Sony, Dell, Adobe.

Microsoft. They have an enormous moat. Their current price is reasonable. Azure is well positioned for growth.

Sony. because it's still one of the most undervalued large cap stocks out there. If you're looking for value this one should grab your attention. They have very diviersified revenue streams and a great management team. It's kind of like buying a micro ETF.

Dell. Market leader in multi-cloud solutions. So they also have a big moat. Good value stock & great management. Like with Sony, until recently the market was significantly undervaluing them imho (has been somewhat corrected in the past 2 months).

Not a fan of Netflix and Amazon at all **at their current prices**. For Amazon first of all their stock is very expensive right now (as in high P/E, P/FCF and EV/EBITDA). Their business prospects have to extremely good to be worth it imho which is just not the case: competition is extremely heated in ecommerce and they're failing to get marketshare everywhere outside the USA. They're very dependent on the saturated US market.

But today's leaders are not tomorrow's leaders.

Can you, or anyone else, be 100 or even 95% certain that Intel won't make a comeback or that another company won't become a major player?

The weakness I see in TSM is that their business is entirely arms-race based which means business can be easily taken away if they lose their lead.

Whereas the FANG companies are entrenched.

Make a better spreadsheet program? Doesn't matter people aren't going to learn it, they will still use Excel.

Whereas for TSM, they don't have a product that people stick to. It's contingent on them being the best manufacturer.

That's why for semiconductor companies, I don't think betting on one company is a good idea. The semiconductor industry is promising overall.

You're not ""arguing"" because you have a misunderstanding of market dynamics, much less options.

It is better to be in covered call on a long term underlying position when a stock price moderately dips, then when it rises beyond the strike price. You retain the stock, gain the premium and have the ability to dollar cost average down. 

If it swings wildly either way, however, it is better to be in no CC position at all.

For example, my own recent real-world mistake with a CC: In January, wrote two $20 calls on Canon ($CAJ), when it was ~$18, for a Feb 19 expiration. I expected it was growing slowly and wouldn't hit that target. Instead, it went to $22.30 and the options executed. 

With a premium of .55, those covered calls alone ended up costing me $350 in potential profits. CAJ hasn't dropped enough to allow me to rebuy in profitably; currently holding right at $22.

This is why CCs aren't bullish, no matter that there is a modicum of ""profit"" involved. They are a short hedge (literally are called a ""*short call*"") -- and risky in stocks that go up more than anticipated.

If one is bullish on a stock, and expect it to go up, a cash covered  put is the better play.

No. It's not. That's worse. You have less money. Most people like having more money. You'd have less. That's bad. Get that through your head. Losing money is bad.

The part that most people don’t know about is that it cost GM roughly $90k to make one and they sold it for about half of that. 

How? Government subsidies. Not a huge surprise but that’s a big part of the future of EVs. Seeing it already in Europe. 

Most people don’t care about the disadvantages of cobalt or lithium, they care about the personal cost. Once an automaker can make an electric car that’s more affordable (seems like Tesla and GM might be getting close), people will buy it.

OC 1:  I don't know about these new machines.  Automobiles?  They are constantly breaking down.  Can't go more than a mile before something goes wrong.  So, can't really go outside the city .

OC 2:  Sure.  Range anxiety is real.  And I can get a horse anywhere.  Automobiles, at least the one you can afford, is built by one company.  You get rid of your horses and the company goes out of business, doubles or triples prices, etc.  What then?

OC 1:  And they run on what?  Gasoline?  Who makes this stuff.  There is one farmer with a still in this state.  And it's made out of oil which is dug from the ground.  What if that runs out?  I mean how many dinosaurs were there in the world?  500?  1000, max.


OC 2:  And where are they all made?  Hardly an awesome state and too close to Canada.  


OC 1:  Also, aren't they real dirty.  The shit that comes out of the tailpipe is terrible.  At least the horse's shit is organic and can be recycled.  According to Martha, the automobile smoke will wreck the earth.  Yeah, I'm sticking with my horse.

The Chrysler Pacifica is good also because it has two electric motors in the transmission, no reverse gear and no altinator.  One of the motors acts as a generator and reverse is electric only.  

The conundrum with all electric vehicles is people are worried about range anxiety yet at the same time the average daily commute is like 40km.

372,ICE," I am an electrical engineer working on some of the issues regarding the power system.  You are correct that if every ICE vehicle were to be instantly replaced with EV the current system would fail.  As it stands there are high penetration areas of EV in neighborhoods that have problems when everyone gets home and starts charging. 

That all said, the current bulk power system was designed for a single direction of power flow.  But we are working to solve problems that are arising from bi-directional flow.  The same is true with EV.  The areas that are slow to evolve and upgrade are that way because of costs to the utility and subsequentially to the consumer.  People don't want to pay more when the current system works.

That said, there are people currently working on issues that allow charging your vehicle while driving on the road (future) there are new battery chemistries that will reduce the impact to the environments, there are companies working on battery swapping in lieu charging where you hit the ""gas station"" pop in afresh battery and drive off, among other ideas.

The generation mix is being updated but is a slow process.  As we see higher penetration of distributed energy resources that are successfully paired with existing ICE and nuclear, we will see the associated improvement to EV charging infrastructure also. As is think of it, right now our electric system is built on the beach and tide is eating away the foundation.  All we are currently doing is shoveling more sand under the walls to hold the house up.  What we need to do is pick up the house and move it to a new location with a new foundation that is solid.  The walls (infrastructure) are the same but the foundation (generation) are stronger. But to do that costs money and requires action.

You originally asked for a discussion for/against.  Let me make it even easier than that.  I am not sure who the victors will be Tesla, Lordstown, VW,  or some new firm in the future but if the is not a request and demand for more environmently friendly transportation, buildings, and generation then no corporation will work towards them. We as investors are looking to make money from the corporate work but we as consumers must help to guide the corporations on where the needs are and where they should invest time and money. 

Currently, green tech is just as ""dirty"" as oil.  That said, when more brain power is spent in improving the technology, the sky is the limit.

They’re now spending to expand into sports betting in many states. They are poised for a huge surge in revenue once more states open up to sports betting and their regional physical casinos can open to the old normal. 

They’ve also been wildly successful with their online sports book compared to others in the states they’re in. December 2020 they had a 19% hold (profit from all bets; [source](https://twitter.com/darrenrovell/status/1351636718437490688?s=21)). Industry “normal” is between 5-10%, with anything above 10% is seen as an unreal profit.

Their differentiation between them an DKNG, FD, MGM, etc - is they aren’t spending millions on promos and advertising. Penn’s purchase of a portion of Barstool has allowed them to have a built in marketing army that doesn’t need to offer $500 play credit with initial deposits or needs to run advertisement during nationwide sporting events (disclosure - I don’t live in a state where Penn operates an online sports book - they very well may be advertising hard in those states). Barstool does their shtick, makes money for themselves through their sponsors with their streams, shows, blogs, events (launch weekend in Chicago this weekend for example) and makes money for PENN through their droves of fans using Barstool Sportsbook as their online interface. 

They’re only operating in 5 states or so (no research but I think it’s just NJ, PA, MI, IL for now - I’m sure I’m missing somewhere). I think the price is reflective of the inevitability of it coming to 20, 30, eventually 50 states plus territories.

While I think they’re probably overvalued on today’s metrics - I see the appeal long term with the projection they can duplicate their current success in the states they’re operating in when then add other states (note: currently not in FL, CA, NY, TX, OH, GA, NC - 7 of the top 10 states in terms of population).

391,AAPL," My understanding and interpretation is that the payment for order flow is applicable to the role of the market maker where algorithmic trading is involved. Investments are longer term and I don't see how short-term trends would reliably aid in long-term investments.

So, as an example in my mind (Note, I have no clue how the algorithms are actually implemented), if the market maker algorithm sees that there are plenty of incoming bids for AAPL at $120 (every 5-10 minutes), then the algorithm can decide to buy (bid higher quantities of shares) as the price dips further below $120 and sell higher quantities to divest of excess (profitable) shares as the $120 target is approached.",tohuynName,2,/r/stocks/comments/m9xau0/payment_for_order_flow_vs_market_making/grphshh/,0.019,0.962,0.019,0.0

396,AAPL, The role of a market maker is to provide liquidity they assume the risk of holding a supply of the stock. When you look at a stock price for instance AAPL the bid is 120 and the ask is 120.59 most of the time the market maker is both the one selling and buying he he buys for 120 and sells for 120.59. Market makers do not speculate on the stocks value for instance they will not hold on to a stock when they think the price is going to move up nor do they sell when they assume the price is going down. They make the difference between the bid and the ask and that is their role.,chev415,1,/r/stocks/comments/m9xau0/payment_for_order_flow_vs_market_making/grpghaj/,0.018,0.962,0.02,0.0772

400,DD," The general consensus for the absurd height limits of the share price during the short squeeze boils down to two mechanics: Margin calling shorts and supply. Over the past 3 months there have been numerous predictions of GME %float shorted ranging from 40% to well over 900% due to Naked Shorting and illegal options activity. If somehow the hedgefunds Citadel, Melvin, Blackrock, etc managed to illegally short GME past 100%, they literally have to buy back *all* of the shares *multiple* times. Retail investors such as the millions on r/WallStreetBets and r/GME can be speculated to hold anywhere from 1M to 20M of the available float, with brokers like Fidelity owning large portions of shares. The plan since December is buy and hold, no matter the share price, to both spike the price and pressure the shorts to cover way out of the money, or to margin call them so they are forced to do so. Holding the supply with over 100% demand will cause the share price to skyrocket to *unfathomable* levels, and thinking a certain price is unreachable due to factors like GME's market cap being sent past even some first world countries isn't logical. GME's share price currently does not represent the company, but rather the supply/demand as well as all the blatant manipulation going on between whales. 

Also, the DTCC and overall insurers of the stock market are well worth 40-60 *trillion* dollars. If GME were to squeeze and retail holds, they sure can cash out at anywhere from 100k to *2 million dollars* per share.

428,IMO," Selling covered leaps is a double edged sword. Because it’s expiration is so far out and the stock is particularly volatile atm, the premium is nice and juicy. Issue is that theta decay is going to take a while to kick in having such a far out expiration, so you won’t be able to buy to close at a decent price for a while (unless the stock sees a drop in volatility or stock price presumably). Good thing though is that you’re not forced to potentially pick less appealing strike prices to be exercised at if the stock price drops and you’re flipping short expiration covered calls.

Additionally, if an attractive price point rolls around and you need/want to close your position before the expiration date, you’ll have to buy to close that leap before selling the underlying no matter what the cost is or you’re stuck with a naked call.

IMO, if you want to ride out the volatility gain train sell covered calls 30-45 days out, buy to close when you’ve secured ~75% of the premium through the theta decay ramping up, rinse and repeat until you’re done. This’ll keep you closer to strong theta decay and give you greater flexibility rather than being locked in a covered leap (but remember that if the underlying drops in price, premiums will be lower in the higher strike price ranges forcing you to pick strike prices that are less appealing to be exercised at).",TheBioScout,1,/r/stocks/comments/m9skka/whats_your_opinion_on_selling_long_calls_on_sens/grpi4lb/,0.077,0.817,0.106,0.8596

430,TY," There's a lot of instability in the market as a whole, and with rising treasury yields and expanding inflation both being hot topics right now, we're seeing this shift from tech and innovation to bonds, consumer cyclical and defensive buying, which is going to be a hard hurdle for these social stocks to really take off. 

The fundamental model for bond valuation is the inverse relationship it has to long-term treasury yields. TY going up means bond prices go down, and TY going down means bond prices go up. The obvious time to get in on a long-term bond for any investor is when the treasury yields start increasing. 

I expect we'll see a continued market sell-off if the Yields continue to rise. Increased treasury yields almost always signal a large shift from steady growth in stocks to volatility, and typically the best place for long-term investing is somewhere that has low volatility and steady growth. Bonds are becoming more and more attractive for this reason.

The reason why consumer cyclical and consumer defensive usually perform well despite market volatility is because people will always need consumer discretionary products like food and clothing. The continuous need for these products keeps demand high and valuation steady, regardless of what happens in the rest of the market.",Those_Silly_Ducks,2,/r/stocks/comments/m9izyj/the_resemblance_between_weed_stocks_2018_and_ev/grnvzwf/,0.022,0.814,0.165,0.9822

459,RH," I have had TD Ameritrade since long before Robinhood was a thing. I recommend it but can't review any of the other platforms because I've been so happy with TD, that it's the only one I've ever used. I known its GUI is more complex (from looking at friends' RH accounts) but you have to consider what you loose at the cost of ""user friendly"". Same goes for ""free"" trades. These guys are making tons of money somewhere ... hint? It's usually by selling your personal information.

I know when you are new a lot of the terms and features are very confusing so that ""user friendly"" veneer is very attractive. But I recomend taking the dive and learning what those terms and features are/do. They are offered for a reason and I doubt that reason is to keep customers away.

468,CVS," There is no fucking way Rite Aid’s PBM business grows market share substantially with the barriers to entry for most of that market. Drug companies have no reason to shell out big rebate rates for them until they can offer volume or something else compelling. Right now EnvisionRx is like 2% of the market and all of their growing profits have come from just general pharma price squeezing and acquisitions rather than true share growth, which are coming under more and more scrutiny by the federal govt these days and is therefore risky to bet on continuing.

Unless Rite Aid can truly differentiate their PBM’s value prop (maybe something like outcomes-based contracting), they will continue to be vastly inferior to competitors CVS, OptumRx, and Ascent (inclusive of Walgreens and Express Scripts).

Would also echo what everyone else has said here in that Rite Aid stores are unclean dog shit. Even a location design revamp would best case bring them to parity with their competitors, again unless they do something truly revolutionary. But no signs of that so far. 

For now, this stocks right where it should be. Show me  a clear sign they’re taking an innovative path and I might think differently.",Joker_SJX,1,/r/stocks/comments/m9y6y7/rite_aid_no_matter_how_you_cut_it_it_is_the_right/grpv9y3/,0.063,0.768,0.169,0.9702

472,RAD," Excellent question.  Let's have a look at some of the areas in which Rite Aid put its cash in 2020.

First of all, you are correct, that on November 30, 2019, Rite Aid had $289 million in cash on hand, and that amount was reduced to $51 million by November 28, 2020, a reduction of $238 million.

When considering available cash, it is important to also have a look at the net accounts receivable level.  This is the amount of outstanding payments that are owed to the company.  In the case of a pharmacy such as Rite Aid, the net accounts receivable level is largely representing the amount of outstanding reimbursement payments that are owed to Rite Aid by the US government and insurance companies for previously filled prescriptions.  From 2019 to 2020, RAD's net accounts receivable level increased by $80 million.  Therefore, this $80 million in the higher receivable level can explain a portion of the year-over-year reduction in cash on hand.  After subtracting this $80 million from the $238 million cash reduction however, we are still left with a year-over-year cash reduction of $158 million.   So where else did Rite Aid's cash go?

Well, in the 4th quarter of 2020, Rite Aid acquired Bartell Drugs and its 67 pharmacies in the state of Washington for $95 million.  So if we subtract that from the remaining $158 million shortfall, we still have to explain the remaining reduction of $63 million in cash.

Now let's have a look at Rite Aid's long term debt situation at the end of 2019 and 2020:

RAD Long Term Debt November 30, 2019 = $3.566 billion

RAD Long Term Debt November 28, 2020 = $3.201 billion

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RAD Year-Over-Year Debt Reduction = $365 billion

So, when considering that Rite Aid was able to reduce its overall long-term debt by $365 million over the course of the one year period, it may be logically concluded that the reduction of cash on hand can be attributed to:

1. The increase in the net accounts receivable level.  ($80 million)
2. The acquisition of 67 Bartell Drugs retail pharmacies.  ($95 million)
3. The reduction in long term debt ($365 million)

474,RAD," Thank you for you comment and insight. However, despite the view from a single store, Rite Aid as a whole is rapidly becoming a terrific American comeback story.   Rite Aid did install a new CEO in 2019, and the new management team has done wonders during that time.   Since the new CEO took over, RAD's stock price has tripled.

The company has grown EBITDA to +$8 or $9 per share and now has free cash flow. The new-look stores of the future are being rolled out in select areas. Also, the PBM business, ELIXIR, has grown revenues between 23 - 29% each of the last 4 quarters on year-over-year comparisons.

They company has indicated that they will continue to work to address situations in which individual stores may not be performing as expected, as all good companies should do. However, this view on a single store is clearly not representative of the tremendous success story that is building for RAD, nor is it indicative of the fact that the valuation currently assigned by the stock market is only half of the break up value of the company.

The due diligence stands for itself.  Either it is accurate or it is not.  Each person can read it and decide if it has merit.   If calcuations are right, their right.  It doesn't matter who is offering the material.  Let's be honest, for every post on social media pertaining to stocks, someone has a long position and someone has a short position.  All posts therefore come from one perspective or the other.

I do **not** work for Rite Aid.  If I did, engaging in discussion of due diligence pertaining to the stock would be illegal.

555,DD," Not all, there are a ton of factors that influences a company to turn profit. It can range from the company itself to other external factors. 

Company factors can be a product coming out that replaces the usefulness of the current product (think blackberry phones vs IPhone). Your usual fraud cases or bad capital allocation. 

External factors can be political, or even the market overvaluing the company to a point where all future expectations are set so high that stock price has no room to run (like Microsoft from the 2000s/ .com bubble). 

When you invest in a company, you invest in it after you’ve done all your DD and analysis and come to the conclusion that the future outlook of the company is worth your time to invest to a point where taking on the risk is worth the reward. Buying a stock on the premise that “most companies in 10 years make profit” is pure speculation and you’d be better off just gambling in the casino to save the 10 year wait.",WonderfulIngenuity95,2,/r/stocks/comments/ma14k0/holding_through_a_recessionmarket_crasg/grq6zxw/,0.062,0.837,0.1,0.7269

Looking at the negative reviews though I saw a theme of disconnected management and products that don't work quite as advertised.


While I think every good company will have negative reviews, it was enough for me to not invest. I was trying to determine if the company was marketing focused or engineering focused and judging from their job ads (all sales) and common complaints in the reviews, I decided not to invest.

Because the total cost of a fully automated data warehouse solution was extremely compelling.  We are a midsize firm that has big firm data needs.  The fact that i don’t need expensive database administrators to manage our data infrastructure is extremely compelling.  

Tbh when i selected Snowflake almost 3 years ago it was a bit of a career risk. Fortunately the solution has been incredible and they have lived up to their promises

Now. Back to stock.  Do i like databricks? Sure. But it’s more a solution for experts and has a higher TCO imho.   The valuations seem a bit ahead of their growth.  Is it a great product? Yes.

596,TLRY," I understand that TLRY at 45.00 hurts right now, but they are about to be the largest Mj company in the world. If you have the patience, you will see it surpass that. It might be this time next year, or perhaps even a little longer... I’m excited to see the long term play here. If you don’t need the money immediately, I’d let it ride. I bought early last year around 10.00, and didn’t sell when it hit 65.00 (which I kind of regret, as I could have doubled my shares, if I had foresight) because I believe in three/four years or so, it could hit closer to $90.00-$100.00. 

I might be crazy, but I see this stock blowing up over time. Long term gains here, even at $45.00

Maybe buy more and average down? 

I’m not a financial advisor, just a hopeful person bullish on Mj stocks.

597,TLRY," The issue I have is while TLRY might be the biggest, they are Canadian and the instant the US legalizes, US tobacco companies are going to go all in on Marijuana.  Many have already bought up a ton popular Marijuana-strain trademarks and own vast areas of land that could quickly be changed from tobacco production to MJ production.  There were be plenty of US-based startup companies looking for investors too.  Why hold bags in a foreign company that will need to penetrate the US market that so many people/companies have been working to prime for explosion for years? 

I know TLRY will jump if/when the US legalizes, but there has been pretty much zero talk of that happening.  Individual states continue to legalize, but TRLY can't legally access that market.  

To me it seems like a better idea to sell after the merger and then maybe go back in on TLRY once serious US legalization talks start happening.  They have struck some deals supplying medical marijuana to other countries but I don't see how those deals are really going to increase the value of their company long term.  If you look at it now, they are trading at roughly the same price as they were before the last supply deal was struck in February.",OneRougeRogue,1,/r/stocks/comments/m9zope/any_lesser_known_hard_seltzer_stocks/grpxvaq/,0.035,0.878,0.088,0.9307

602,DRI," I mean I'm not going to tell you not to gamble your money because I'm not a fucking soy like the rest of the commenters. If I had 50k and I wanted a 200% return in a year I wouldn't buy stock I would buy options. And right now my options picks would be UAL and DRI. These companies both stand to grow quite rapidly from reflation even though they're pretty close to pre-covid levels.

 I would trade ITM debit spreads each for an expiry of about 5 months out. I would leave 20% unleveraged in a cash balance on the account to roll the trades if they didn't go in your favor (that's why the DTE is only gonna be 5 months so you have an extra month for each play if you need to roll out while still giving you the maximum amount of time possible to be profitable). You could in theory put that 10k into stocks but if you were going to you would buy something high liquidity, low volatility so you could easily sell them for a small profit when needing to buy back your option to roll out but probably better to just leave it in cash.

For debit spreads to be profitable they both need to expire in the money and you don't have time to lose money to learn that. Basically the stock can go up or down all it wants but because the value of the spread is made up by the difference of a sold option and a bought option it's not going to effect it a whole lot because they will both gain and lose value in tandem. So you would be buying fairly deep in the money spreads to make sure that it is most likely for you to win. Look for the deepest ITM option spread that is 5 strikes apart that you can buy for ~$2.50/share (that would be 100% profit at expiry). Since it's already in the money, it has intrinsic value and you don't even need the underlying asset to go up to win it just needs to stay above those two strike prices. I would buy 20k of each because ""diversification"" and what not.

Right so you have 10k in cash balance, you have 80 debit spreads of UAL expiring in August, and then another 80 debit spreads of DRI expiring in August. I would probably set a calendar event for july 1st and then delete the app so I couldn't watch it like a hawk waiting for it to print and likely sell before it did. You want to check back up on it around 30 DTE because that's when theta starts to really kick in and the price of the stock starts to matter. 

And then if it prints you made 40k with a total balance of 90k and then rinse and repeat. 18k cash balance 36k in one stocks options (you will need to revaluate what stocks are good picks at that time obviously) and then 36k in another. If it prints you made 72k with a total balance of 162k.

No one knows what the market is going to do tomorrow. Is this smart? Maybe. Will this work? Again maybe. What I will tell you is I think this is the lowest risk way to make 100% in 6 months. And just to be clear you can do this with any stock it doesn't have to be a risky stock that you don't know much about. You could do this strategy with apple, or Google, or Amazon, or tesla, or Walmart, literally anything and it still works. And it's the same payout and risk/reward.

604,UAL," I mean I'm not going to tell you not to gamble your money because I'm not a fucking soy like the rest of the commenters. If I had 50k and I wanted a 200% return in a year I wouldn't buy stock I would buy options. And right now my options picks would be UAL and DRI. These companies both stand to grow quite rapidly from reflation even though they're pretty close to pre-covid levels.

 I would trade ITM debit spreads each for an expiry of about 5 months out. I would leave 20% unleveraged in a cash balance on the account to roll the trades if they didn't go in your favor (that's why the DTE is only gonna be 5 months so you have an extra month for each play if you need to roll out while still giving you the maximum amount of time possible to be profitable). You could in theory put that 10k into stocks but if you were going to you would buy something high liquidity, low volatility so you could easily sell them for a small profit when needing to buy back your option to roll out but probably better to just leave it in cash.

For debit spreads to be profitable they both need to expire in the money and you don't have time to lose money to learn that. Basically the stock can go up or down all it wants but because the value of the spread is made up by the difference of a sold option and a bought option it's not going to effect it a whole lot because they will both gain and lose value in tandem. So you would be buying fairly deep in the money spreads to make sure that it is most likely for you to win. Look for the deepest ITM option spread that is 5 strikes apart that you can buy for ~$2.50/share (that would be 100% profit at expiry). Since it's already in the money, it has intrinsic value and you don't even need the underlying asset to go up to win it just needs to stay above those two strike prices. I would buy 20k of each because ""diversification"" and what not.

Right so you have 10k in cash balance, you have 80 debit spreads of UAL expiring in August, and then another 80 debit spreads of DRI expiring in August. I would probably set a calendar event for july 1st and then delete the app so I couldn't watch it like a hawk waiting for it to print and likely sell before it did. You want to check back up on it around 30 DTE because that's when theta starts to really kick in and the price of the stock starts to matter. 

And then if it prints you made 40k with a total balance of 90k and then rinse and repeat. 18k cash balance 36k in one stocks options (you will need to revaluate what stocks are good picks at that time obviously) and then 36k in another. If it prints you made 72k with a total balance of 162k.

No one knows what the market is going to do tomorrow. Is this smart? Maybe. Will this work? Again maybe. What I will tell you is I think this is the lowest risk way to make 100% in 6 months. And just to be clear you can do this with any stock it doesn't have to be a risky stock that you don't know much about. You could do this strategy with apple, or Google, or Amazon, or tesla, or Walmart, literally anything and it still works. And it's the same payout and risk/reward.

SPAC team valued at ~2.4-2.9B and what's changed since then? Nothing material. SPACs in the 30-90 days following merger often see a lot of sell-offs from the PIPE investors, so there easily could be some more selling ahead, finally, look at the chart on finviz and we can clearly see a downward channel that this thing is moving through, ~$19.90 to me looks like a pretty important baseline if CHPT can bounce and hold low 20s I will buy in, if not I would imagine we could see low teens again, at which point I would say I would agree with you in saying that it is substantially undervalued.

633,CHPT," Correct me if I’m wrong, but wasn’t the drop in valuation due to underwhelming sales. Which was due to a pandemic going on much longer than the original valuation projected?  I’m not saying it’s going to shoot up overnight but their footprint is 76% of the industry. You need to account for the increase in EV buying. It’s set to be 30% of vehicle sales in 8 years. This is where these valuations come from. 

CHPT is a minimum of 10x the size of blink, just based on revenue, charging footprint etc. blink market cap is 1.65B, Chargepoint is 6.72B.  Blink is clearly the overvalued one. Not to say CHPT may drop to 20 or 21 (at which point I’ll double my position because my current average is 25 per share).  But to not think they have the potential to double that share price in the near future I honestly do. It understand.

643,CHPT," Your a hostile dude, I’m not saying you need to start a position just tell me where I’m wrong here...

Chargepoint is 10x the size of BLINK, minimum 

Chargepoint footprint is 76% of the industry 

Blink market cap is 1.6B trading at 37.75

Chargepoint market cap is 6.8B trading at 23.60

Either blink is severely over valued or CHPT is severely undervalued

647,CW," What CW is doing here is completely ridiculous and should actually be punished. I don't know who of you have looked at her model, but she is assuming Tesla's production will grow 80% annually instead of the 50% EM is targeting (which is also too high in my opinion, but whatever). Also, in 2025 she expects a third of all revenue to come from a robotaxi service 2 times the size of Uber and Lyft combined. Even if you believe in Tesla, but it should be clear to everyone that this is bullshit. It really just seems like a desperate attempt to manipulate the stock. Please take a look at the model itself and don't just read the headline: the assumptions it makes about the future are completely unworldly and indisputably wrong.

651,ATH," Yeah, it’s an awful take, I don’t feel great about where the Nasdaq is at right now but the worst case scenario for me at least for now is that it loses the area around its old early fall ATH and fills the Election Day gap. That is 11.5k in the Nasdaq-100. 

And this could just easily not happen either. There’s a weird mix of complacency, but also too much negativity going on in tech. Plus you’re now about 10 days away from better seasonality in tech and despite the SLR exemption not getting extended, it sounds like a flood of dollars could hit the market in April.

Tech’s due for a good stretch, if this week doesn’t turn into a total tire fire stretch, I think it’s happening after this week.

I don’t think Tesla will be leading that stretch, but if tech as a whole is doing well, they will hold up. They peaked in early January, but only lost 7% initially because outside of that late January hiccup, the Naz was on a roll until mid February...",95Daphne,2,/r/stocks/comments/m9wkru/cathie_wood_ark_is_delusional_she_is_trying_to/grp8gvu/,0.115,0.781,0.104,-0.5106
652,NOW," People always bring up the fact that she correctly called Tesla's current price several years ago. The thing is that price was based on robotaxis becoming a major part of the business NOW. We're not even close to that and they still make the vast majority of their money from selling cars. Now she's predicting, again, that robotaxis are just around the corner. We'll see how that works out for her.

What really happened to Tesla was speculation on a massive scale. I could have predicted Gamestop to be a $300 stock last year because Ryan Cohen will turn it into the Amazon of video games or something. People would have rightfully called me an idiot. But I was right about the price, so does that make me a genius? No, I was just lucky.
