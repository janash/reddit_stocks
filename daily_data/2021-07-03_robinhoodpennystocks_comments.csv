[https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AAPL/performance](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AAPL/performance)

The site shows the 20 years performance is over 30000% due to stock split.  Apple has a tendency to split when it reached $700 to $800 dollars.

It had split 5 times in 40 years.

55,RS," Ycharts is the only great source for historical outstanding shares that I've found. They have a paywall, but if you Google ""AHT shares outstanding Ycharts"" you can click into it, see a graph and table. There are lots of filings that you can find outstanding shares in manually too, but then you have to account for historical splits as well. I don't follow the company really, so can't speculate on earnings or speak to the assets. My understanding is they have a lot of debt. Maybe they sold some assets to settle debt, maybe the value of their assets was reassessed lower. What I think the ATM and RS suggests is either the stock is overvalued (most likely,) and/or they see dilution as a better option than debt. Paying off debt improves bottom line, and ironically when you have negative EPS, diluting looks like an improvement too (smaller loss per share.)",stompingllama,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/oclbm0/aht_announces_101_reverse_split_an_hour_after/h3xn88g/,0.122,0.623,0.255,0.9754
