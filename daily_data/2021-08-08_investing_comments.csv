0,AMC," I'll bite.

Many investors want nothing to do with GME or AMC because of their volatility. If you are investing for long-term gains, why risk playing the lottery with these stocks? On March 10, GME dropped nearly $170 in thirty minutes. Many investors don't want to deal with those types of swings.

As for whether GME/AMC is a ""rock solid squeeze play,"" that depends on if you are a believer or not. The believers are confident that there's no way HFs came close to covering their ridiculous short positions in GME (an SI of +140%) in late January and thus another squeeze is destined to happen. IMO, the case for AMC is not the same as it was not shorted to the same absurd extent and it has a much larger float (i.e. way more shares available).

The non-believers look at the combination of each companies' fundamentals (or lack thereof), their current reported SI (13–16%), all the hype and volatility, and they understandably want nothing to do with either of these stocks.",hthe3rd,678,/r/investing/comments/p01j0p/trigger_warning_meme_stock/h83niky/,0.05,0.865,0.085,0.5095

Both the game and movie stock plays are a gambit - basically buying blind lottery tickets of which you don't know the date they'll hit or the prize amount. That in itself isn't an *INVESTMENT* strategy. It's the difference between seeking long term growth vs landing on red.

Again I'm in both, but I'm not ALL in. It's not a sure bet as you have to remember one thing - the system that caused this screw up is the same one that bailed itself out in '08, and has overthrown entire governments on the behalf of fruit companies in the name of profit.

10,AMC," Comparing AMC and GME shows you don't understand that one has fundamentals and the other doesn't. GME is debt free, expanding, and has 2b cash on hand. They are also working on fulfillment centers similar to Amazon's, and are increasing their online presence and efficiency (deal with Twitter, for example). AMC is still 4b in debt and has no future prospects besides the continued reopening of theaters. Comparing their leads, Ryan Cohen blows Adam Aron out of the water in terms of strategy, future vision, and past experience with running a company. So let's approach it this way: factor out the squeeze play on both stocks. GME is a solid investment, albeit risky since its growth is speculative (but so far things are looking good). Cohen is aiming to push GME to compete with Amazon and steal some of its market share, just as he did with Chewy. If GME were to even capture 10% of Amazon's market share, the stock would be worth around $2000. AMC is not a company I would touch if I didn't think it would squeeze. It's a failing business and there is literally no future vision besides hoping that COVID goes away and theaters reopen fully. Then you'd have the massive amount of debt to worry about. 

If you want to factor in squeeze plays, GME will make you more money assuming something happens. It is far more heavily shorted than AMC. AMC was a sympathy play and some say a distraction when GME first squeezed, but has now for some reason taken the main spotlight. And no, reported short interest is not accurate. These crooks lie all the time about short positions, short calculations were changed by reporters \*mid-squeeze\*, and there is evidence that suggests ftds have been hidden in options. You know where to go if you want to find more information on this.

- new chairman is ex Chewie CEO

- new CEO who is ex Amazon CFO

- brand new division of employees focusing on NFTs/crypto space

- tons of new expanded product offering online.

- extremely fast delivery , sometime same day with Doordash.

- boosted PR team led by ex Chewie exec. 

- loyal customer base / investors

- brand new fulfillment center on the east coast with more to come.


Anyone saying GME is just a meme stock, or too volatile isn’t doing much research other than reading Motley Fool articles.

To many investors in GME , it is no longer a short squeeze play, it’s a long play with on a company with a lot of potential making all the right moves. 

If I presented you those facts without the ticket name attached I think everyone would agree it sounds like a good investment. Yet when you say GME people automatically discredit it as “dying brick and mortar” which is the most ignorant statement that can be made about the company at this time.

Let me start off by saying that even if I was told by a time traveller from the future that GameStop does NOT squeeze. I would still not sell a single share. Why? Because GameStop has some serious fundamentals behind it. Ryan Cohen built and insanely successful company - Chewy. He is now chairman of GameStop and has continuously been involved since. Their website and logo are undergoing transformation. They have aquired are building new Amazon sized distribution centers. Their earnings are continuously growing. They also have issued new shares and not only eliminated their 500m debt, but also raised nearly 2 Billion in fresh capital. They moved into the Russel 1000, and now the sp 400 midcap.  There is news about their NFT platform and possible crypto dividend. The news keeps coming out. 

I have not researched AMC, however it seems there is not really this kind of fundamentals backing behind AMC.

26,GME," It's really awesome to read how the vast majority of market participants don't understand the turnaround in GME nor are they following the executives who have taken the helm. They're shifting into an ecommerce disruptor, but then they're going into technology. Gaming is going to grow exponentially in the next decade. They're positioning to be at the center of it. You can't really think of physical hardware- that's a dead stop. We're talking about gaming on blockchain, we're talking about digital assets, transference of digital information, NFTs. Gamestop is well positioned to develop a Steam killer and take that further than they could have ever dreamed. Of course their valuation looking backwards makes absolutely no sense- but if you want to take a chance on their vision... it's clear there is real potential here. These are the kinds of bets that you can make a-symmetrical returns because everyone else thinks you're wrong, or an idiot, and maybe you are, but it's your money. I see Gamestop as a Netflix-esque shift in how we understand gaming and it's interaction in our lives. Netflix changed how we interact with media, challenged incumbents (like AMC) and Gamestop will do the same thing but challenging the hardware monopolies and the gaming studios. It's going to open a new world of potential for independent developers, studios, content creators, gamers... Truly power to the players.

34,GME, I personally conducted large consumer survey in the U.S. using a reputable third-party online surveying platform (something I have extensive experience with as a part of my profession). My thesis was U.S. retail owned at least 74MM shares of GME. I purposefully designed the study to produce extremely conservative results. What did I find? U.S. retail alone owns at least 2X the outstanding shares. That’s why I think a squeeze is incoming for GME. Shorts don’t even matter ...

The AMC option premiums are insane.  Until those option premiums die, nobody is selling the shares.

There is no MOASS coming, though you never no if the stock will pump again and create new bag holders.  Even if it were to do that, anybody holding 100+ shares could free ride those shares relatively quickly selling extremely OTM calls.

I had buddies who jumped into AMC at the end of May.  His cost basis for his shares is -$70, and he’s achieved this by selling triple digit calls ($100s-$140s) weekly since June 1st.  He continues to sell the furthest strike every week.  He got $0.23 for the 8/13 $80s on Friday.  The guy has literally made more selling calls than if he would have been gifted shares for free and sold at the absolute peak price.

Short term downside is the call premiums are coming down.  When they fall, holders will sell.  When the stock even shows a blemish of a run, call premiums jump QUICK, and back around we go.",GeechQuest,2,/r/investing/comments/p01j0p/trigger_warning_meme_stock/h84sdj8/,0.071,0.833,0.096,0.6369

And so now they think that that's the  right way to do things and are conditioning themselves to think like that. Unfortunately nearly all of these people are going to learn a very expensive lesson. New investors that make money on a gamble usually predictably follow that up by making more risky investments using even more money. And they're not prepared or conditioned for the drops and how to act so they're likely to panic sell or double down on riskier positions trying to win back losses.",RaptorMan333,5,/r/investing/comments/p01j0p/trigger_warning_meme_stock/h84oby5/,0.161,0.709,0.13,-0.5169

76,AMC," >it’s now worth 3x what it was then

You simply should not compare stock prices from that big of a gap without checking for market cap/dilution at each point. AMC shares bring prices at double what they were two years ago should be compared to market cap which averaged about $1.5-2B for almost a year and a half. The squeeze drove that up and AMC is currently at $16.8B: roughly 11x the valuation from two years ago.

To be fair, through share offerings in a squeeze AMC did wipe out a fuckton in debt so they should be worth more than the $1.5-2B mark so let’s say $4B for the sake of estimating a fair market share price.

Look at the bottom and peak of GME, AMC, they both had very similar market caps at both their highs, lows, and now. AMC doesn't have anything left for it to squeeze. It went from 1B market cap to 30B market cap. 

You can say 'price doesn't matter' all you want but good luck getting AMC to keep flying past a 30B market cap for what the market seems to consider a dying business. 

Here's a piece of advice. Lots of volume and shorts doesnt equal a squeeze, it just adds volatility(normally a bad thing). The squeeze comes in when serious good news comes out.

115,AMC," You need to get out of the Reddit echo chamber a little bit. Naked shorts is just not a thing; it doesn’t exist. I was one of the people who actually made some money on GME because I bought it in 2020 and sold end of Jan 2021 when it squeezed to above $300. So that short squeeze has already happened. 

I can’t speak much for AMC but I do know that AMC has issued a lot of shares in the last few months, diluting the float.

And shorts don’t *have* to cover - big investors can sit on their short positions for years unless there is a positive catalyst for the stock. That positive catalyst happened for GME in the form of Ryan Cohen’s involvement earlier this year, but AMC doesn’t have anything like that. Melvin Capital had been shorting GME since 2016, and it took over 5 years until they were forced to cover, but even that happened because of Ryan Cohen getting involved and changing the outlook of the business. Even if AMC has a catalyst like that some time in the future, it may be many years for that to happen, and big institutional shorts will happily sit on their positions for that long, but the small time bag holders on Reddit probably won’t.

127,TV," Here's one concept... Gaming moves to streaming and subscription based through blockchain powered decentralized networks. Instead of gaming through your PS5 you game through your TV, your phone, your computer. As TVs become basically like big screen computers they will have more capability to fulfill that. 

There's no reason to think in the future you will buy a game, physical or otherwise. Most of gaming will be free- however all the add on purchases in the games will be big money. Those who facilitate the gaming networks, the developers, the players, the content producers, will thrive.

130,DD," I don't think it's unreasonable to take issue with suspect internet poll data that is analyzed by a random person with dubious intention, and presented to an audience that seeks validation from the results.  Moreover, it's an audience that would actively oppose any scrutiny.  There's legitimate research that can have holes poked in it by peers, yet if you're in an environment that discourages such a thing, it can seem more convincing than it really is. This isn't just about meme stocks, I wouldn't like this kind of supposed DD for any environment.

But on the topic of your link, you mentioned that you assumed they were all naked.  Again, most of these shorts would be synthetic, and thus have the benefit of delta-gamma hedging.  These are balanced positions that would not induce mass price fluctuation.  A far cry from what would happen if they were naked.  So even if your source is partially correct, it's extremely unlikely that the result would be indicative of what you're expecting.

As I highlighted earlier, naked shorts are not nearly as commonplace as the meme hive would have you believe.  Pulling billions of extra shorts out of their ass is an easy way to get past the criticism that the numbers simply don't work out for a squeeze.  Anyone who's selling you hidden numbers is going to be full of it the vast majority of the time.",BuzzardBlack,2,/r/investing/comments/p01j0p/trigger_warning_meme_stock/h845org/,0.079,0.874,0.047,-0.7969
131,IMO," Clearing out their debt and raising capital was great, no doubt.  But the other things you listed aren't anything special IMO.

* Same day delivery is great but why would anyone pay extra for that when they can already get those same items through Amazon Prime, which most video game-playing Americans already have?  Or why would they use it at all when most things people want to buy from GameStop are digital anyway?

* Expanded product offerings is moot - literally every other retailer will have the same things GameStop has.  

* Amazon + Chewy execs coming over is people must blindly hyping themselves up.  Besides Ryan Cohen, what do you literally know about any of those people?   

* NFT's - maybe, idk.  But what GameStop is going to do with NFT's that every other retailer isn't also going to do?  What is the moat there?

Console sales throughout this year has shown me that there really isn't any loyalty to GameStop among video game fans.

151,CVM," Didn't list it because I thought there was a rule against posting about micro caps, but I guess that's just wsb. Company I'm talking about is Cel-Sci, ticker CVM. Their CEO has been complaining about shorts manipulating the stock for years, but since the phase 3 top line results were released he's been going a bit nuts over it. 

You can go down the rabbit hole yourself if you want to. Basically the trial was for advanced head and neck cancer. Their drug Multikine is an immunotherapy drug that patients got immediately after diagnosis. After that, patients got the standard of care, which means surgery followed either by radiation or radiation+chemotherapy. It's important to note that you can't design a trial that denies patients the standard of care, so they had to include both groups from the get go.

Their trial's endpoint was 10% improvement in overall survival. For the group that got chemo Multikine didn't do shit. For the group that got radiation and surgery they increased overall survival 14%, and the survival benefit increased over time meaning that for a lot of people it seems like they're basically cured. Survival went from 42.6% (control group) to 62.7% (Multikine + no chemo) after 5 years, so a 29% increase in survival, 14% in absolute terms. When you combine the groups together the survival benefit was under 10%, so the market took this as failure and the stock dropped from $20 to around $9.

But basically the company is now applying for approval for the 40% of patients in the non-chemo group and seems likely to get it. They have orphan drug designation, there's been basically no progress on treatment for these patients in decades, and Multikine had literally no negative side effects in any patient population (insane for a cancer drug).

I'm not a cancer researcher and it's probably not smart to just trust the company on the likelihood of FDA approval. [Zacks issued a report](https://s27.q4cdn.com/906368049/files/News/2021/Zacks_SCR_Research_06292021_CVM_Vandermosten.pdf) that estimated the approval odds at 85%. Idk, don't bet the house on anything binary but there is a lot of upside at it's current price. 

From their recent [letter to shareholders.](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210707005476/en/CEL-SCI-Corporation-Issues-Letter-to-Shareholders#.YOWY5tck9ug.twitter)

> Uncertainty from the fact that the chemotherapy treatment arm did not work allowed attacks on the stock. It looks as if the shorting volume on our stock on the day of the announcement was 56% of the daily volume and around 40% for the next few days (www.shortstockvolume.com/Chart/CVM/). That should not be possible since there are not enough shares to borrow and brokerage firms are supposed to check if stock is available to borrow before selling short.

* Expanded product offerings isn't moot -- it's adding to what spaces they're competing in. Combine that + free same-day delivery on mamy items, it is a competitive advantage on everyone, including Amazon, in whatever spaces they're doing this in. I bought Philips Hue lights and networking gear from there recently, got them delivered faster than I could have from Amazon and for the same price I'd have paid.

* Not knowing anything *specifically* about any of those people (besides the new CEO Matt Furlong) is irrelevant -- there are tons of great businessmen and women I haven't heard of. The thing that I consider a selling point here is that a large number of these people were willing to leave very established, high level careers at industry and worldwide leading firms. People who manage to get to the levels they were at at those types of businesses are typically good decision makers, and don't frequently leave the positions they were in unless it's a phenomenal opportunity. The fact that Cohen could sell *them* on his vision enough to leave very cush and safe jobs for positions paid significantly with company stock should be a bullish sentiment for anyone from the outside looking in.

* NFTs I already addressed this point, but there are a few different possibilities that have been speculated on with these:

One is the obvious, an NFT tied directly to each share of stock and/or an NFT dividend now that the company has no debt. This answer is purely tied to the squeeze speculation and would not have any business value outside of shareholders. If short interest is as high as speculated, obviously Overstock is the example to look at in terms of how that could play out.

The second (and more interesting from an actual business perspective) is creating the first marketplace for used digital games. There are tons of applications here -- games tied to an NFT that can be resold like their old used games B&M model in the digital space, which could allow game companies to capture additional revenue depending on how that digital marketplace GS operated. I could also envision a scenario where you purchase an NFT character or skin (or create your own) that can be ported across games. They could create a marketplace where in-game purchases can be made with GameStop $. Game developers have another place they can get revenue from for those in-game purchases, and more importantly for customers they can have currency in one location and be able to spend it on many different games as they decide what they want instead of having to buy money for in-game Call of Duty purchases and decide that they want something on Fortnite now too but have unspent COD $.

At this point, they are all speculation -- but that's the point. There *are* quite a few real, genuine business functionalities that could be tied to NFT digital ownership that a well funded and good gaming company could take advantage of. The NBA made hundreds of millions of dollars on digital NFT highlights, which is small fries compared to these possible use cases. Realistically, even if GameStop is only able to capitalize on *one* of these ideas (or many others I failed to mention or haven't been mentioned publicly in speculation), they would be seismic shifts in the gaming industry that they would be first to market on. An analogy would be getting in on Netflix before they shifted to digital streaming while they were just mailing DVDs.

* So, if NFT related to stock, highly likely you will see a squeeze of some sort. If NFT related to gaming, much greater than 0 chance it changes one of the fastest growing and largest industries in the world. So the upside is tremendous. 

* I don't know anyone who thinks that Amazon has good customer service. Historically GameStop has not been good on that front either. However, Chewy became the leader in it's industry with a huge focus on this. A personal touch goes a long way, and like pet-owners, gamers are a pretty loyal and obsessive group. Cohen has made a point every time he talks on 'delighting customers'. I trust that a business under his leadership will always have a strong customer focus.

* Add on the absolute mountain of free marketing they've gotten over the last 8 months. The head of the SEC mentioned GameStop by name in an interview on CNBC this week. He didn't mention any other individual equity by name. There have been multiple congressional hearings where the business has been discussed. It's been in the news. Look at the front page of reddit -- basically every day stories about GameStop are popping up there. There is a ton of name recognition coming from all this. It's why they're re-branding EB Games in Canada back to GameStop, and are expected to continue that trend overseas.

175,GME," The number of people in this thread comparing GameStop to Amazon - favorably, at that - is eye opening and kind of hilarious, but also kind of twilight-zone bizarre.  It's absurd on so many levels.  Like, Amazon's web/cloud services division is literally the backbone of the internet, completely hosting or otherwise provided services for everyone from Netflix to Spotify, from AirBnB to Lyft, from Pfizer to General Electric, and on and on.  Amazon owns Whole Foods, Audible, and Twitch, each of which is a massive player in their respective markets.  Also, Amazon has a digital home assistant in tens of millions of households and counting.  And then, only on top of all that relevant, current, and growing business with both leading edge and time-tested companies, they're, ah, you know, pretty big in the online retail world, I hear.  

Yeah, sure, in some sense, ""Amazon is not invincible.""  But GameStop isn't going to kill it.   The idea that Gamestop will out-compete Amazon because maybe they'll be a bit better at selling games and game-related merchandise... right.  Sure.  We'll see, I guess.  

I can't tell if all this is just a lingering haze from the media coverage of the GME situation, or if that sparked a bunch of new interest in investing from young people who aren't thinking much harder than, ""game companies are great, I like games and so do my friends!"" or... what.",veryreasonable,13,/r/investing/comments/p01j0p/trigger_warning_meme_stock/h84ho1i/,0.011,0.758,0.231,0.9948

>because gamestop is not a brick and mortar company now. It is an ecommerce business with profitable physical locations(we shall see in next earnings call).

You are incorrect - they are not profitable.  I'll wait for the earnings call again but [I had this same conversation](https://old.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mdm08h/an_accurate_headline_for_once_we_love_to_see_it/gsb83nx/?context=3) last time quarter and nothing has changed about the business since then from what I can tell.

But fine - they're an e-commerce platform, cool. Why would anyone shop there instead of Amazon/Walmart/Target/etc?  The console releases proved that people do not have loyalty to GameStop so don't tell me ""people love them and will support them"".  Americans go for the 1) cheapest and 2) most convenient option always.  Period.  There is nothing GameStop does that someone else doesn't already do better and cheaper.

>which is good for business as they spend a lot of money buying merchandise and can convince friends and family to do the same(see tesla/apple)

This is literally untrue based on the number for the last two quarters.  Also, Tesla and Apple (despite the vitriol surrounding the stock) objective sell amazing products.  People want to buy them and that has nothing to do with family members convincing them.  GameStop has a dinky  website and a bunch of small stores in the strip mall.  That's a silly comparison.

*Sidebar but the ""recipe"" isn't some industry secret.  It just takes a long time to build out the necessary fulfillment centers and delivery network.  GameStop will be able to piggyback on the existing infrastructure by paying for it, sure, but that's not some mystery that can be cracked in the 1-2 years you suggest.  It's a network of physical locations that simply take time to build.",DrewFlan,2,/r/investing/comments/p01j0p/trigger_warning_meme_stock/h84ceir/,0.021,0.83,0.15,0.9895

That doesn't refute my point.  Everything GameStop offers is the same as any other retailer offers - it isn't exclusive.  That is why it's moot.  You got a lightbulb quickly - cool.  112 million people have Amazon Prime and your one shopping experience is not going to be the norm IMO.

I could also envision a scenario where you purchase an NFT character or skin (or create your own) that can be ported across games. 

All of this is great but what is stopping other companies from doing the same thing?  And why would a game developer choose GameStop over anyone else (or doing it themselves)?  Are you suggesting that GameStop is poised to be the industry leader in NFT distribution?

Interest rates are still low, have you looked at refinancing under 3% for a 10 or 15 year loan?   

Given rates are so low some people would refi snd take money out to invest where presumably you could make more, I would not suggest that, but carrying low interest rate debt currently isn’t bad.  If you refi at lower rate and for 15 years, you would have some extra money to put into 529s and 401K.  Not sure I would bother maxing out HSAs, for me at least HSAs have minimal if any return.

246,SO," It’s all about the cashflow, pulling your equity out and cash on cash return. Appreciation is just dessert.

For an example, I just bought a $160,000 duplex ($80,000/door) in my market, since we are doing it inside a corporation, we require 25% down ($40,000). We are throwing approximately $60,000 cash into the property for a renovation and we expect to push the value up towards about $280,000 range.  Once I go back to the bank and refinance this property at 75% LTV (loan-to-value), the bank will now mortgage my house for 75% of $280,000 ($210,000) and the rest of the cash is mine (aside from appraisal fees, etc). That means I put $70,000 in my pocket out of the $100,000 I have into it ($40,000 down payment + $60,000 renovation). So now I am into this property for $30,000 total.

The rent will bring in ~$2500/month. My mortgage is expected to be about $1100/month. With additional expenses we are looking at about $1800/month in expenses total.

SO - the cashflow on this would be $700/month or $8,400/year.

$8,400/$30,000 invested is a return of 28%. Try to find that in the stock market, very hard to obtain. Now rinse and repeat and you have yourself a massive real estate portfolio that will likely appreciate with rental increases year after year and you have yourself a real good investment.

It is not easy to find properties this will work on. You have to find something super run down that nobody else wants to buy because of the work (for example this one has bed bugs, was smoked in, etc.), but when you DO, it is well worth the extra effort.

Competitors: $DKS and $GOLF

DKS isn't quite the same I'll admit but it's difficult to find someone similar to Callaway. 

When looking at the P/E of these 3 Callaway is significantly higher at 63 vs 16 and 10. 

With the acquisition of top golf, maybe this is fair especially with the top tracer technology but still feels high to me. Anyone able to justify this? Maybe I'm missing something.  


____________________

The most interesting part about this earnings is that this will be the first quarter where they include all of their earnings from the top golf acquisition (the previous earnings only had 2 months). However, this also seems to be expected based on analyst rev estimates. 755mil rev for this quarter (95mil higher than last). With Top Golf making around 1.1bil in revenue a year this doesn't seem to be toooooo high but I have a suspicion it won't be a ""huge"" beat. 

The other worrying thing to me is that last quarter they refused to provide guidance due to covid and while covid is definitely better now that from last quarter it is still an issue. If they refuse to provide guidance again it could be an issue. Should be noted though last quarter saw a big pump even without the guidance. 

EPS is another weird one by analysts for me. I can't seem to figure out why they have it at 0.01 or even 0.08 on the high end. 

Bloomberg doesn't even have any forecasted IS so I can't see what its about and it's just worrying to me. If anyone here has any idea why EPS is so low please share!

If earnings is a beat we could also very likely see some upgrades over the next few weeks to run up the stock. Right now analysts think golf is dying off and is for old people but with top golf there could very well be an influx of new golfers getting into the game. 

I don't think that we can really say this is a long term hold cause everything is a bit funky with COVID but I think there's a lot of room to go up.

257,GDP," >over the long-term, Treasury Yields are inversely correlated with Debt/GDP ratio. 

So you're right about the correlation, over time yields have fallen in line with an increase in national debt/GDP.  But it seems like you're inferring a lot of causality here, and despite a lot of other posters making ""LOL so wrong"" posts, I don't think they actually understand why you're wrong either (because they'd have posted it if so). 


Yields are effectively a reflection of growth and inflation expectations.  So the question is what do we expect to happen to GDP growth expectations, along with inflation expectations - and what can we extrapolate from that in terms of rate shift expectations?  

The relationship you speak of is a result of falling GDP growth, and falling inflation expectations pushing down nominal rates.  At that same time the deceleration of GDP growth coupled with a nominal increase of government deficit spending has ballooned the nominal debt levels.  This obviously isn't a huge concern because cost to service the debt is actually at a lower point today that almost any point in our nation's history.  

So, your thesis can't be ""as debt increases yields must decrease"".  this is simplistic to the point of being wrong - and one must ask the question where will these future drops in yield come from?  Are inflation expectations falling?  Are GDP growth expectations going to fall?  Most macro data points to the opposite - although I will mention outside of places like social media (reddit) and retail focused media (cnbc) nobody is really concerned with inflation - the 10 year breakeven sits at 2.33%.  Not exactly reflective of the sort of fear mongering you see here. 

But, the 30 year sits at 1.94%, the 10 year is at 1.31%.  Both of these are respectively down about 40bps from their recent peaks back in March of this year.  

So to me it seems like you kinda have the right understanding - that inflation fears are over-stated, and that because of this the inflation expectations baked in to long term yields are going to fall over time as these concerns are proven wrong.  You cited a bunch of wrong logic to get there, but the idea isn't wrong.  

The problem is, that trade was 4 months ago.  Markets have already re-aligned yields to a significantly lower spot as the concerns over inflation have subsided.  You're basically jumping in too late, and basing it off retail sentiment rather than reading the numbers - retail is always late to the game, and this is a perfect example of it.  You can see the inflation and growth expectations rise and subside in the 10 and 30 year if you look at the yields from year to date.  Those have already subsided, sure there's lots of people still on social media and in retail oriented media babbling about inflation.  But the actual trade is done, that outlook has already shifted in the actual fixed income markets.",MasterCookSwag,5,/r/investing/comments/p0i98y/inflation_fear_mongers_are_wrong_treasury_yields/h872tnc/,0.129,0.762,0.109,-0.9389
258,GDP," The irony is that GDP/debt ratio will remain unchanged with gov't spending. 

GDP is a function of gov't spending, as is debt. Let's say you cut gov't spending to pay down debt, suddenly GDP shrinks as well.  

I think Treasury yields are more of a function of willing buyers. The more buyers you have, the lower the rates. Look around the globe, people want US Treasuries.",HankSullivan48030,0,/r/investing/comments/p0i98y/inflation_fear_mongers_are_wrong_treasury_yields/h86u2ua/,0.165,0.736,0.099,-0.5859

This has already been alluded to in other comments, but your assertion is very incorrect. Lower Treasury yields exist during/after recessions, which is the same time that governments run larger deficits.

260,GDP," ""either GDP will have to grow faster than the national debt or we have to cut spending dramatically (neither are happening under Biden).""

Debt/GDP at the end of 2020 was 129.19%. Debt/GDP at the end of Q1 2021 was 127.65%.

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GFDEGDQ188S](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GFDEGDQ188S)

Real GDP growth was 6.5% in Q2 and 6.4% in Q1. With inflation of around 5% we're talking about 11+% nominal gdp growth. GDP growth is growing faster than the national debt. Added to this, the fed is expanding their balance sheet by $120 Billion/month, so a huge portion of this debt is being monetized and is not included in debt held by the public, which is substantially lower than total debt and has also increased from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021.

265,MMT," Look, I'm going to go a bit easy on you here.

Government spending does not result in large cash additions to the banking system, government spending is a net zero change in money supply.  In literally any modern economy the financial system creates the overwhelming majority of the money in a given economy, and the central bank regulates the pace at which money is created via monetary policy.  Government spending is not a factor here - as every dollar spent is either collected via tax revenues or borrowed via treasury issuance.  

Certain central bank policy strategies, QE being one of them, can have the impact of pushing down long rates - typically they cannot have a strong impact on real rates of return, only nominal ones.  

MMT is a term referring to a loose collection of heterodox ideas with very little support in the field of economics, it is not a well flushed out school of thought, and it does not even contain a working model or proof of the ideas.  It has gathered some name recognition outside of economics primarily due to endorsement by certain political figures, but that's not really indicative of it's standing within actual economic circles.  

Also, to be frank saying ""look up MMT"" comes across like you're just hoping to not need to defend an idea.  It's like me saying ""transfer payments are more inflationary at the ZLB than monetary stimulus, look up keynes"".  Like yeah, the idea is supported by most broad schools of Keynesian derived thought - but holy shit talk about a lack of specificity.",MasterCookSwag,10,/r/investing/comments/p0i98y/inflation_fear_mongers_are_wrong_treasury_yields/h873zsv/,0.046,0.837,0.117,0.9375
