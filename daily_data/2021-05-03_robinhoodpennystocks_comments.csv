OCGN is bullish for me.
Market closed with an acending triangle pattern on 30 min chart.
Likely  breakout to around 14 this week, then retest of 13.25...

If it bounces back then 13(ish) is new support, and 18 is new resistance. 
Optimistic target price is 18-20.
Conservative target price is 16.

Or I could be wrong cause my TA is trash and it just tanks lol.

Edit: looks like I was right yayyy!

41,ETH," I'm with you here. 30% of my portfolio is market ETFs for long term retirement. It used to be 40%, but I've moved 10% from here and 10% from my monthly trading allocation to make my portfolio solidly 20% crypto. Most of that ETH because I think we are going to see a transition from those who entered into bitcoin post 50k move into ETH, plus all the incoming (alleged) institutional buying in the next few years.

Thinking of it in terms of trading and catalysts - we don't yet have one for ETH. Of course all Crypto is speculation with a capital S compared to the normal speculation of the stock market - but ETH moving to the new proof is going to make it more palatable than those stuck on headlines about BTC energy consumption / being priced out this far.

ETH is in a good place right now, and I'm interested to see how the rest of the next 5 years look. If there is one crypto that is the mainstay for me it's this one. Though I do have BTC as well and am not bashing it.
