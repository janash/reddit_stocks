15,TK," I work at a cancer center on the east coast that does alot of investigational drugs (we also have many Ewing sarcoma patients: its a very rare cancer) and I have not seen these drugs yet.  These are very small studies (n value is low).  It is early in the game for these drugs, alot of things could go wrong.  I'm sure there will be side effects if they do a trial with more people.  Also I wonder how difficult it is to prepare these drugs (I work in the pharmacy and this can make or break some of these drugs).  The TK drug wasn't doing to well in the data until cohort 9. I wonder what they changed ?  I've seen drugs ike Lartruvo get fast tracked with Orphan status then fail in the macro data when the number of patients is higher (it was taken off the market).  ROR sounds like a good new target to try, but I've seen other targets like hedgehog fail when you use more patients. TLDR: these are early trials with low amounts of patients, anything can happen especially failure.

That said their followers are idiots. Don’t do any DD on stocks and just buy what they’re told being left to hold the bags.

33,DD," I guess it depends on how the tweets are presented. I don't blame someone for buying before tweeting - especially someone with a large following. To do otherwise would be dumb and make me wonder why they're not prioritizing their trades over their tweets. So that being said, if someone with thousands of followers tweets that they are accumulating, it comes off as disingenuous.

I imagine a lot of these guys are good momentum traders, and that's how they get the followers in the first place. Maybe it's an double edged sword, where they'd be foolish not to adapt once they see a pattern developing of price bumps after their posts. What grinds my gears is when they post really dumb DD. Part of it is DD simply isn't a big factor of their strategy, but I can't help but feel they're often playing dumb and they know whatever catalyst they're pumping is BS. If they never respond to feedback pointing out some of the less glowing aspects of a catalyst, that's a red flag they're being disingenuous.

All said, my favorite Twitter posters are focused more on general advice and information, not calling out entries.  For sheep blindly following someone on Twitter for those entries, I guess they get what they paid for literally and in terms of the effort they're putting in.

69,RNA," I remember seeing a skin care product selling at high end retail advertising it has real RNA in the bottle that did X, Y and Z. 

People were willing to spend money on RNA skin product not realizing how underwhelming it is. 

Resonance energy / Quantum Field Theory are popular topics and some theory could make sense  even if the research has no statistically robust difference between their method vs many other methods. On curiosity alone, I purchased some and it is one of the few green lines in the portfolio today. :/",davidkozin,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/nh0dag/qnta_the_otc_stock_that_needs_to_be_on_your_radar/gyuasiu/,0.067,0.826,0.107,0.5994

Do your DD. Yes there is a $CELZ community on Reddit. Not huge but knowledgeable. Read up on the science. They do not just use stem cells. They use stem cells to reprogram immune cells.

73,BIG, I really agree that rental car companies are hot right now. I'm BIG into europcar but the price of Hertz is based on buyout hype.

74,BK," Thanks for the feedback. I just can't reconcile how the financial analyst say the BK settlement is worth $7-8 per share, yet it sits under $6. Somebody is missing something.
