0,UK," Mate, my family runs restaurants in the UK, there are always problems ontop of the existing duties you have to do. 

They always have high staff turnover, waiters/waitresses are usually young and end up going to university or moving away. Chefs/cooks can be difficult people to manage. Ontop of that you have to deal with health and safety standards in your local country.

The easiest period when running a restaurant is the opening.  Because all of the equipment is brand new and will have 3-4 years before it starts breaking or needs maintenance. After that its like you're constantly on catchup. Its a full time job in itself. 

Yes running a portfolio is much easier, you aren't reliant on anyone but yourself, you can easily invest in blue chip stocks for the dividends or EVS or whatever massive growth sector you want and know you'll be set for life regardless. If you want a low maintenance business, the food industry isn't it. I wouldn't touch that industry with a barge pole.",Duckgamerzz,101,/r/stocks/comments/n1os7z/is_have_a_2_million_portfolio_better_than_owning/gwet54x/,0.042,0.853,0.105,0.8506
1,AAPL," I only recently talked with a friend about exactly this topic.

consider this: avg margin of profit for large companies (not outliers like AAPL , MSFT etc) would be like 2-5% / year. and thats being generous. there¬¥s business that are happy to beat 3% regularily.

now lets compare a super boring portfolio:

all money into one ETF:like $VOO: 10-15% / Year.

&#x200B;

that might not be the smartes way to allocate for risk,, but I think it covers the basic idea.

conclusion:

why on earth would I invest all my capital into a company that is much more complex, harder to manage, has social responsibilities to employees, legal stuff..

when I could also invest it all into the market, get much higher returns and basically have only taxes to worry about ?

so from a returns / mnagement perspective, the portfolio wins, hands down. I don¬¥t think the comparison is fair though.

socially and in regards to ethics, I would think owning and running a business has far more value than just owning shares.

you provide jobs, offer measurable services / products to society. you bring value.so even though it is much more hassle and stress, I think running a business is actually worthwhile.

67,AAPL," Yep! I sell covered calls on all my positions, its a great and low risk way to generate modest returns and get a tiny bit of downside protection. Its also where most people get their start with options, then typically dabbling into cash secured puts to run the wheel strategy (sell puts until assigned the shares, then sell calls on that and repeat until the shares are called away and you sell puts again). I typically sell my cc's at .30 delta or lower. I also use long dated itm options (LEAPS) which don't decay as quickly as near dated ones to simulate a buy and hold strategy, then sell calls against that. This is known as ""poor man's covered calls"" and are the most profitable part of my portfolio. Its a synthetic/leveraged buy and hold strategy, I typically reinvest the short call profit into shares of the underlying. So instead of buying 100 AAPL shares, I buy 5 itm 2023 AAPL contracts and sell calls near term against those. That way I control more shares, typically 5 contracts at .7 delta (delta = move in the underlying aka if AAPL moves a dollar in either direction and I have 300 delta, I would make or lose 300 dollars). Perfect strategy to run on low volatility names like AAPL, MSFT, or etfs like SPY, QQQ, IWM, etc and great if you can't afford  a 1 lot (100 shares).

74,AAPL," Haha yeah sorry, when you're just starting out it can be a lot. To clarify, you always get the premium when you sell a contract upfront in full, it's yours. So if I sell a covered call on AAPL at the 140 strike expiring in two weeks for 50 dollars, that 50 is now in my account. Its mine. If AAPL finishes above 140, my shares will be called away, I will get 14k(100 * 140) PLUS the 50 that I get to keep. You could buy to close early though and thats highly recommended as expiration approaches if you wanted to in which case your profit would be 50 - cost to close.

87,GME," As they say, 'No risk-it, no biscuit.' But that wasn't investing, that was gambling. I was buying a risky depreciating asset (long call option) and shares with an asymmetric risk/reward profile. The lessons to learn from my GME experience when trading are threefold:

1. One in the hand is worth two in the bush. Take profit! I rode 30k to 75k, took profit, rebought at 40(I genuinely do like the board and the space so I was happy to own at that) then sold out again at 300. Then rebought again at 120 for where I'm at now. When I say sold and bought, I was using sold options to do this, so collecting 2-5 grand a week at least via premium through march just to take my positions because implied volatility was so high. That was the 'theta' piece of my long position.
2. This isn't an investment strategy. You can use options to get a lot of leverage, but its not sustainable to simply jump from meme stock to meme stock using long calls on high IV names. Thats a suckers game. Thats WSB in a nutshell, 'lambo or ramen', many more ramen eaters than lambo drivers doing scratch off options like that.  If you win at the casino, you walk away, not walk over to a different game and put it all on the line again. 
3. Taking this gambling analogy further, you always want to be playing the 'house' where possible. You want to sell risk to people that depreciates over time. Selling options is simply selling insurance. On the put side, you get paid upfront to take on all the risk the stock goes to 0, and on the call side that it goes to infinity. As long as your positions are covered, and statistically speaking even uncovered on lower iv names, this is an actual investment strategy over time.

Options are hedging vehicles at the end of the day. They give you different tools for your investing strategy besides 'buy and hold' and allow for managing risk. I am not in the business of buying them to manage risk usually, I simply use them to extend buy and hold with leverage while maximizing my dividends, per say. People tend to think of them as degenerate lotto tickets but thats just one small piece, though what you read about because getting rich quick stories seem attractive. A more systematic way to do options is playing the house by being the seller in my experience. Don't go gambling unless you have an actual thesis on the company and want leverage, and even then not when its already priced in. It's usually too late to get outsized gains after there's a big movement in the stock, GME was unique in that respect.",RetireWithRyan,2,/r/stocks/comments/n1iva8/my_friend_wants_to_buy_dividend_stocks_then_sell/gwfz5j9/,0.045,0.816,0.139,0.994

162,BLNK," Biggest regrets of the week:

- being frustrated not getting into LVMUY so bought it yesterday when it was up .06 when today instead it was down 2.5% or so. Dumb and impatient.

- Buying BLNK after seeing it was down 3.4% yesterday only to see it be at 2.6% when I updated the stock seconds before buying and panic bought it rather than waiting another 20-30 minutes. Emotional.

- Lesson as usual: Be patient and emotionally controlled!

Might read some more of the Intelligent Investor this week..


But overall a really nice solid week. A bit concerned in my greed I bought some slightly volatile stocks which goes against my thesis, but time will tell and we shall see next week with another 6-7 of my stocks up for earnings..

166,EC," Notice how before earnings calls big companies will hype up their business by throwing some good news out there, then their stock goes way up for a few days just before it tanks. This can't be a coincidence. Mofos are trying to find people willing to buy their huge loads of stock (whoever those people are). It would be a perfect time to unload. A lot of volatility due to ECs, and some hype around a company will let big investors sell at high prices without being noticed. If you know an EC is coming up and a company is feeding you some news, especially news in a ""potential"" area, not facts, I suggest you sell and sell quick. Watch for unusually high daily volumes prior to that. Pfizer's EC is coming up next week. They just said covid medicine ""might"" come out by the end of the year. I wonder what's going to happen with their stock now. Watching it like a hawk.

181,AMZN," So AMZN looks like its going to consolidate back down around 3400. This after having one of the best earnings quarters imaginable for a large cap.

Wondering if it might be time to do the unthinkable and sell my AMZN positions. Jassy/Bezos seem fixated on the ""prestige"" of having an insanely high stock price. Institutions are just going to sit on what they have. Fractional share investors don't have the capital to move a stock like this or they wouldn't be fractional share investors. Seems like retail will be priced out for the most part. 

Also, no dividend. So there's really no reward for just holding for years.

Great company that will continue to be profitable. However, as growth investors, is anyone else wondering if their money might see better returns elsewhere?",Furloughedinvester,-1,/r/stocks/comments/n1qa65/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_apr/gwgnhof/,0.032,0.753,0.215,0.9807

319,IMO," All of which increases price which lessens demand when there is a cheaper, better alternative.  Especially if you can *own* your own alternative.

1. Finite supply drives price and profitability up

only if people are buying.  And only if the sources - which they don't necessarily control - are available.  Given global trends of limiting increase oil production that seems like finite is going to become *very finite* over time.

2) FALSE it is MORE in demand.

Because of world population growth, but the oil demand growth is dropping *proportionate to the population,* so no, not really the demand you're looking for.

*3)*  You think green energy will keep getting subsidies forever?

They barely do as is (comparatively.)  And as that subsidy increases coal and oil's will decrease, causing even higher prices that, again, drives people to look for cheaper alternatives.  You think they're going to do better without  $20.5 billion **annual** in subsidies (Oil Change International).  Don't see that happening.

4)  Negative public opinion is priced in.

Lmao, no it really isn't.  Their interpretation of it is.

5)  Foreignly sourced?! How is that bad? Lots of things are.

Because people would rather own their source of power, or a local source of power, obviously?  Global and local distribution to delivery are also repeatedly at issue.

We can agree to disagree.

The *entire world* is making a shift *away* from their core product - how you think that means their business will do *better* is super confusing.

You think nations are switching from oil stocks because they see big growth in it?

This is kinda all wishful thinking IMO.

edit: also not discussed is what *runs* on oil products, and what *uses* oil products, which people are also pushing away from.  Especially the largest retail consumption of oil - cars.

321,ARE," 1: If people aren't buying then finite supply is a non factor. If they ARE, it drives prices up.

2: What are you TALKING about? If your entire fucking argument is that the supply is finite, any increase in demand increases profitability.

3: As green energy scales to be more of the energy market, subsidizing it all will be untenable. Do you ACTUALLY think we will spend more on subsidizing green energy than the military?

4: This is word salad.

5: Okay so what about all the components in green energy, i.e. photovoltaic, that are ""foreignly sourced"" as you put it.

Oil consumption is going up. Future consumption being won disproportionately by green energy isn't the same as consumption decreasing.",Astralahara,1,/r/stocks/comments/n1spw7/exxon_beats_eps_beats_revenue_driven_by_higher/gwgpu9h/,0.03,0.827,0.144,0.9269
322,XOM," There are a lot of people who have no idea how dependent on hydrocarbons the world is. Sure, there are ""green"" energy sources and those are great, but they have reliability issues that are not inherent with running a coal or natural gas fired power plant. You can't run on 100% green. You have to have a backup. No one wants nuclear, so that is increasingly nat gas. 

Nat gas is huge. We will be on it for decades. You simply can't heat the northern hemisphere with any other fuel source. 

Oil is huge. Plastic demand is rising. That's oil. Fuel demand is rising and will be high for decades to come. The entire global logistics network would come to a screeching halt without hydrocarbons. Container ships ain't gonna run on electric. Airplanes ain't gonna run on electric. Over the road tractor trailers are going to take decades to convert to electric and will entail a massive buildout of power supplies if they converted. Hydrocarbons are king in pretty much everything we do and will be for decades. 

XOM has 37 trillion cubic feet of proven nat gas reserves. As policy makers move to increase population in the West via immigration, you'll see even more demand for logistics services that use hydrocarbons and heating that uses hydrocarbons. People have no concept of how reliant the entire supply chain and world economy are on that stuff.

329,CAR," This resonated with me: 

Tesla's plan is not to be a big EV company. They already innovated with EV years ago. It panned out into reality and changed the market, and it has been going excellently for them for quite some time now. But we're at today, not then, and Tesla is in the business of pushing for innovation around breakthrough ideas. What could such an idea be for today then?

I believe their plan is to be the first to realize the SMART (autonomous) CAR, together with a broad-scale DISTRIBUTED and SUSTAINABLE SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE. Think car that a) drives you where you want to be, b) takes off to find a spot on its own, c) goes to recharge if necessary at a supercharger hub which is d) owned by Tesla with power provided by its own network, power storage, and generation, and e) the car drives back to pick you up when you want it.

And that's why Tesla is focusing on autonomy + energy storage + solar too, I'm sorry if nobody can see that but it'not just to expand their commercial activities by selling batteries and roofs here and there, or making advanced driver assists. It's the start to GROWING into something groundbreakingly different as a company, and they are again going to be the FIRST to do it, thus having a good chance of dominating the future market.

Pretty much like the back then ""overpriced"" Amazon who ""couldn't generate their stock price revenue if they sold all the books in the world"" as any short-sighted ""pro analyst"" would tell.

I'm not saying it will necessarily work out for Tesla. I'm saying though, that it's one of the bets one HAS to take because if it does work, it's going to change the world. Simple as that.

(And I'm also saying that looking at P/E and projecting to EV car sales only is plain **tarded. Just as it was projecting book sales with AMAZN back in the day.)

Pretty much like the back then ""overpriced"" Amazon who ""couldn't generate their stock price revenue if they sold all the books in the world"" as any short-sighted ""pro analyst"" would tell.

I'm not saying it will necessarily work out for Tesla. I'm saying though, that it's one of the bets one HAS to take because if it does work, it's going to change the world. Simple as that.

(And I'm also saying that looking at P/E and projecting to EV car sales only is plain **tarded. Just as it was projecting book sales with AMAZN back in the day.)

374,BB," I mean for me personally the % it has dropped is not nearly as important as to why it has dropped.

For example especially in this market you will get great solid companies dropping just due to the overall market tanking a dump. If I buy Microsoft and it drops 5% on no news but just because of a tech sell off, if I believe in the company I wouldn‚Äôt sell regardless of the % drop. If anything it could be a good chance to take advantage of market fear and buy more.

On the other hand, I tend to ruthlessly cut companies where either the future outlook has changed due to subsequent news/updates since I bought, or where I just f*cked up in the first place.
An example is BB - I admit I got caught up in the Reddit fomo and bought in at nearly $20, only to see it drop 30%. Maybe the company does recover long term but personally I don‚Äôt see it given the management doesn‚Äôt seem great, they‚Äôre a mature tech company not making any money etc.

And that brings me onto my final point - could your money be invested elsewhere? Psychologically it‚Äôs tempting to baghold because then it‚Äôs ‚Äúonly a paper loss‚Äù - but if you baghold for a long time this has a real opportunity cost, as you can‚Äôt use that money for new ideas/companies that might have much better growth prospects.

So yeah in summary, the % drop is really a bit irrelevant - it‚Äôs why that counts.

You should have a DCF or something that tells you a ballpark of what each stock you own is worth and the assumptions that went into it. I personally don‚Äôt like to trim and instead hold mine for the long haul. I also don‚Äôt like moving in and out of undervalued stocks and am fine owning durable stable growing companies. That‚Äôs a personal preference though.

I‚Äôve found over the years that I do better owning a few amount of stocks I know very well than a scattershot approach. 

Personally I think the efficient frontier is a bunch of hogwash right now and owning bonds in this environment is insanity. The theory made sense when you were getting a real return on bonds.

378,BHC," BHC recap of the past 9 Months:

* BHC announced AUG 2020 that they would be spinning off their eye care business (comprised of consumer, contact lenses, surgical and Rx) in 2021...Let's call this NewCo as a name hasn't been announced yet.  The remaining company would be comprised of gastro, derm, aesthetics, generics, neuro and dentistry divisions.
* In JAN 2021, Carl Icahn established 7.8% of BHC and placed two of his associates on the board. 30% of the company is owned by activist investors.
* Two days ago Bloomberg reported that a company insider confirmed Bausch was exploring a potential sale of its eye-care business rather than the aforementioned spin-off.

IMO, if the NewCo does get spun off I believe there is good value here.  The consumer division is extremely profitable, surgical is a good business, and Rx is average.  In contact lenses, they are the number four player with only a 10% share of the category and that business has been losing money for years.

Now what you own will be the remaining business (or ""RemainCo"") which will be the gastro, derm, aesthetics, generics, neuro and dentistry divisions after eye care is spun off or sold.  This business is pretty much trash with the exception of  Xifaxan and the Solta  (which I expect to be sold).

I think there will be a pop in BHC once a decision is made.  I am targeting $40-45 as a possible target to begin divesting.

384,AMZN,"  Directed at your question : from my understanding shorting a stock works the same as below. Short answer = If you have the cash on hand you do not get charged interest. 

Edit : I keep this comment handy to answer this question when it comes up.

Edit 2 : Keep in mind you are only charged interest if you hold the stock over night. So day trading is a bit of a loop hole as you never really hold over night. Ive traded value wise millions of dollars. But that is pretty darn easy when I buy 400 DIS shares at $130 = $52k but then sell it 30 seconds later. And then buy it again 5 minutes later on the next leg up where I would sell it again on the next leg down and then buy it again at the high to then sell it at the low. :) So far in my margin account I have something like $25 dollars worth of interest charges.

I have just went through the woods on this ""well kind of I started 8 months ago on learning wtf Im doing"" Now let me preface this with : All brokers are different. I use E-Trade so TD may vary a bit.

Once you are a margin account you are always a margin account. Once you are a PDT you are always a PDT. You have to jump through some hops to change back down to a cash account. Now lets run through a quick example.

Cash Value account : $30,000

Margin Value with above account : Cash value $30,000 + margin $60,000 = $90000

If this account is PDT depends on how you trade. More than 3 ""I think"" same day trades in a rolling 5 trading day span auto converts you to a PDT account.

\-Trade 1 : 100 shares of MSFT at $150 = $15,000 ==== $5000 against your cash and $10,000 on margin. Cash value in your account is now $25000.

With that trade because your TOTAL shares are valued below you $30k cash value you do not get charged margin interest.

\-Trade 2 ""while holding trade 1 still"" : 1000 shares of PENN at $13 = $13000 ==== $4300ish against your cash and $8600 on margin. Cash value in your account is now $21000.

So with the 2 trades above you have roughly $27000 worth of stocks. However your Cash value is $30000 so you do not get charged margin interest.

\-Trade 3 ""while still holding trade 1 and 2"" : 10 shares of AMZN at $2400 = $24000 === $8000 against your cash and $16000 on margin. Cash Value in your account is now $13000

HOWEVER you now have $15k + $13k + $24k = $42k worth of stock so $12000 on loan from your broker. You get charged margin interest on $12k PER DAY! So with E-Trade that is 8% so with some quick ""probably wrong"" math we get

$12000 \* .8 = $960

$960 / 360 ""360 why they calc 360 and not 365 I do not know"" = $2.66

So to borrow $12000 is $2.66 per day. Really not to bad but can get out of hand REAL fast. get stuck in a trade that you ate shit on and then the stock gets a halt like Linkin Coffee and you are paying interest to not even be able to trade and take the fucking lose.

390,TD,"  Directed at your question : from my understanding shorting a stock works the same as below. Short answer = If you have the cash on hand you do not get charged interest. 

Edit : I keep this comment handy to answer this question when it comes up.

Edit 2 : Keep in mind you are only charged interest if you hold the stock over night. So day trading is a bit of a loop hole as you never really hold over night. Ive traded value wise millions of dollars. But that is pretty darn easy when I buy 400 DIS shares at $130 = $52k but then sell it 30 seconds later. And then buy it again 5 minutes later on the next leg up where I would sell it again on the next leg down and then buy it again at the high to then sell it at the low. :) So far in my margin account I have something like $25 dollars worth of interest charges.

I have just went through the woods on this ""well kind of I started 8 months ago on learning wtf Im doing"" Now let me preface this with : All brokers are different. I use E-Trade so TD may vary a bit.

Once you are a margin account you are always a margin account. Once you are a PDT you are always a PDT. You have to jump through some hops to change back down to a cash account. Now lets run through a quick example.

Cash Value account : $30,000

Margin Value with above account : Cash value $30,000 + margin $60,000 = $90000

If this account is PDT depends on how you trade. More than 3 ""I think"" same day trades in a rolling 5 trading day span auto converts you to a PDT account.

\-Trade 1 : 100 shares of MSFT at $150 = $15,000 ==== $5000 against your cash and $10,000 on margin. Cash value in your account is now $25000.

With that trade because your TOTAL shares are valued below you $30k cash value you do not get charged margin interest.

\-Trade 2 ""while holding trade 1 still"" : 1000 shares of PENN at $13 = $13000 ==== $4300ish against your cash and $8600 on margin. Cash value in your account is now $21000.

So with the 2 trades above you have roughly $27000 worth of stocks. However your Cash value is $30000 so you do not get charged margin interest.

\-Trade 3 ""while still holding trade 1 and 2"" : 10 shares of AMZN at $2400 = $24000 === $8000 against your cash and $16000 on margin. Cash Value in your account is now $13000

HOWEVER you now have $15k + $13k + $24k = $42k worth of stock so $12000 on loan from your broker. You get charged margin interest on $12k PER DAY! So with E-Trade that is 8% so with some quick ""probably wrong"" math we get

$12000 \* .8 = $960

$960 / 360 ""360 why they calc 360 and not 365 I do not know"" = $2.66

So to borrow $12000 is $2.66 per day. Really not to bad but can get out of hand REAL fast. get stuck in a trade that you ate shit on and then the stock gets a halt like Linkin Coffee and you are paying interest to not even be able to trade and take the fucking lose.

401,MAN," Volkswagen would probably not sell Porsche. If something in that direction happens, it would be an IPO akin to Traton (Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles + MAN + Scania).

It could put a lot of cash into the pockets of Volkswagen since a high valuation can be expected (compare to Ferrari).

However: Cash is the very only argument for such a spin-off. 

But why would Volkswagen need cash?

1. Pay off liabilities from Diesel-gate.
2. Finance the transformation to EVs and higher automotive software capabilities.

Now about the second point: Volkswagen is a highly integrated machine in which every passenger vehicle brand plays a role.

Porsche (just as you mentioned) is on the forefront of the premium EV space. They develop most of the premium EV platform which is used by Audi, too (important!). Lamborghini might be pushed to use the Porsche-EV platform as well.

That means at least from the outside it looks like Porsche is an integral linchpin in their EV strategy. Selling off Porsche would give Volkswagen cash but also remove their main premium EV developer from the core. It does not seem like Volkswagen is interested in selling Porsche and thus core competencies.

I could see a spin-off from Porsche play out in two scenarios: either the Porsche family wants to play a different game or activist investors enter the fray.

The Porsche family is relatively passive and conservative (unlike the late audacious, visionary and reckless Ferdinand Piech who is actually a grandson of Ferdinand Porsche). So I don't expect them to move in any significant ways against board and chairman of Volkswagen.

Now if any activists tries to enter the game, they will face powerful opposition: the state of Niedersachsen (aka Germany's Michigan that literally owns a huge stake of Volkswagen and also Volkswagen's powerful union).

*Side note: Underestimating these two players is actually the reason why Porsche stopped being an independent car maker and got gobbled up by Volkswagen.*

402,MSFT," Thank you!  This is such great info. Here is my overall portfolio:

About 75% in 401k: Vanguard index funds 

Another 15% or so in a taxable account: VTI

And the rest 10% is in Roth. Obviously will grow it but $6k a year limit stunts it‚Äôs growth. 

Now... this Roth is where I allow myself some active trading and I really want to diversify away from big tech. I hold so much APPL and MSFT through my index funds that I don‚Äôt want that in my Roth. 

My two big bets in my Roth is RDS (Shell) and now VWAPY/POAHY. Both for similar reasons: I expect Shell to be a major player in green/renewable energy and VW to be a major player in EV. But both companies have established business (oil and gas cars) so not new players with lots of unknowns. 

Depending on how you look at it, they may be considered undervalued or at least fair valued compared to some insane valuations there. 

I don‚Äôt really care about dividends but it doesn‚Äôt hurt that both also pay some. 

So I guess my strategy with both of them is to hopefully see some serious growth and returns in green/EV, while having some level of stability (hopefully).  

I hope this pans out :).

422,COIN," I posted this in another thread about COIN but it's worth repeating.  I read an article that described how this company is actually in a very difficult spot and makes a potentially terrible investment as a result.  Here's the issue:

COIN's revenue is generated entirely by transaction fees, i.e., people trading crypto.  No surprise they've seen huge growth over the past year as crypto has entered a new mania and lots of people have started trading it.  The question from an investing point of view is whether they can keep growing this revenue.

The problem is, crypto's long-term future depends on whether it actually has a strong use case as a currency.  Otherwise it serves no purpose.  Right now it can't be used as a currency because the prices are too volatile.  Something can't be used as a currency if the value can change 20% in a matter of days.  So right now people are trading the volatility (which generates transaction fees for COIN), or they are investing for the long-term in the hope that the value of crypto will appreciate over time.

If the value of crypto eventually settles to the point where it can actually be used as a currency, that would validate the use case.  But the less volatile crypto becomes, the less often people will trade it - thus generating lower transaction fees for COIN.  The other side of the dilemma is that if the value of crypto never settles, it can never be used as a currency and will eventually become worthless.  The value will plummet (like we saw after the 2017-2018 mania) and people will stop trading/buying it - thus generating lower transaction fees for COIN.

In other words, COIN's model depends entirely on people speculating that crypto will eventually serve an important purpose in the world but yet never actually serving that purpose.  And that can only last so long.",SirGasleak,2,/r/stocks/comments/n1tydy/coin_coinbase_global_inc_waiting_to_strike/gwfl1k2/,0.088,0.778,0.134,0.9332
