0,DD," I like exploring a number of sites. I take things with a grain a salt and do my own DD. But I like gathering opinions and info from sources like Reddit subs (not sarcasm), Stocktwits, Yahoo finance, and even Twitter. There are some discord and twitch streams that I enjoy as well. I like getting both bearish and bullish arguments and reading up on the fundamentals before deciding to jump in. Is there a lot of shit out there? Yes. But it also helps me to make better decisions in where I put my money. I haven’t done so yet, but I would like to draw up my first DD post eventually.",palm-vie,1,/r/stocks/comments/mw0g9l/where_do_you_go_to_for_legit_stocks_discussions/gvh3ibu/,0.091,0.653,0.256,0.962
1,DD, I’ve actually found it’s best to do your own DD and trust your gut. Most of my picks have been the best returns in my portfolio. It’s when I let myself get swayed by others who likely have a vested interest (including those here on Reddit) thatI lose the most money.,UpgradeNotSure,1,/r/stocks/comments/mw0g9l/where_do_you_go_to_for_legit_stocks_discussions/gvg2xf4/,0.044,0.694,0.263,0.9274
2,DD," I mean this may only apply if you are European / Scandinavian, but I use shareville which is connected to your Nordnet account. This way you can investigate if the people giving DD (recommendations) are legit, since you can se their portfolio holdings and how much their portfolio has gone up or down, and how long they have been investing. You can even see when people buy or sell - aka if people are all talk and no action. 

Example: You see someone hyping a spac, and see that they are in minus 70 % you get the feeling of a pump and dumb and that this person just wants to break even. 

You can also follow people who have staggering returns, and get inspired from them. Shareville will also rate your own portfolio based on its performance (after 3 months).",Niceguy_Anakin,1,/r/stocks/comments/mw0g9l/where_do_you_go_to_for_legit_stocks_discussions/gvfq2l2/,0.05,0.886,0.063,0.2263

I don't have the time or patience to sort through 8 hours of company mumbo jumbo, but there are people on here that will give me every millisecond of a CEO's life alongside every move a company has made, will make, or thought about doing.

Reddit is really noisy so I don't think it's a good source for pretty much anything with stocks unless you can filter out the noise a bit.

Agree with motley fool

My strategy is that I just go through the robinhood stocks lists until I see something interesting. I then do a quick thin slice analysis on yahoo finance, and go look at what people on stocktwits are saying as a sentiment indicator. If in my analysis I found that the stock is over shorted, an overly negative sentiment on stocktwits could be a good sign. 

This is exactly the formula I used to hit tenbagger after tenbagger going after short squeezes a few months ago. Unfortunately after gamestop, that type of trade has become too crowded so I have been treading water for a bit now trying to develop a new strategy.

42,GME," For me being relatively young I have 3 types of stocks I look at, Solid blue chip stocks, High dividend yield, and very speculative. most of my money is in the first 2. it's hard to filter through the bullshit especially online with TikTok. All these 14 year olds pumping some shit tier stock in order to have a 1000x gain while their portfolio is full of massive losses. When it comes down to it don't let anyone influence your decision making and take emotion out of the buy/sell process.  Look at fundamentals and if you believe in the Stock pull the trigger. All these paid services (Motley fool,  Discord servers, Subreddits, Seeking Alpha, and Tiktoks) all have an agenda. GME was a big example of this, Yes you might make 20x your initial investment but how many losers did you gamble on in the process. Fundamentals, Fundamentals, Fundamentals, Blue chip stocks with solid financials will almost always work out well. If you think we're in a bubble and there will be a pullback look at recession proof stocks, Inflation hedges. Look at what people will spend their last dollar on (Food,Shelter, Ect) and invest in those companies. You could go the route of copying what the US senators invest in, It seems like US congress is full of insider trading and they all get the important info days before an announcement is made.  In the end though I wouldn't put faith in what anyone in online message boards says about stocks, 99% of us are NOT financial advisors. You might get  good advice but others will be bad and they want you to hold the bag after they cash out on a pump and dump.

46,GME," Reddit is good, but honestly I feel like the tried and tested methods and lessons aren't that hard to find, and will often come up time and time again in good books. Cliches such as 'time in the market beats timing the market', and the general understanding that investing should probably be over longer periods, and not a couple of weeks, or months.

I know starting out, had I held all of my investments from 2017\~ and continued to invest, I'd be significantly better off (potentially 5-7x higher networth). Obviously this factors in the massive growth for companies such as Tesla, and all of the craziness from 2020. Not to mention selling off my bitcoin in march last year, to then see it go to the moon in recent months. had I held that, and the stocks, whilst continuing to buy more, I'd be a millionaire!

But you know what else I would be? A smart-ass know it all. Honestly, I feel like a lot of investors are just lucky. Follow the tried and tested methods, be careful, try to invest more into ETFs and have a smaller allocation of your wealth in individual stocks and exotic assets such as crypto.

Additionally, their podcasts aren’t that bad either (and are free).  A good example is them recommending Pinterest lately. I looked into it, and started doing my own research on the side for it. I noticed it was a great company I wanted to invest in it.


With that said, take everything you read online about stocks with a grain of salt.  It really seems like the most bearish or most bullish opinions get the most traction.

51,GME," This is probably one of those 'internet rules' or whatever, but generally speaking subs that are more niche or focused and are smaller will have a greater feel of community, a lot less memery and more depth.

If you're interested in stocks because you want to make a lot of money and you don't care how, then yeah finding legit discussion is gonna be hard. And rightfully so, because if you show up not having done your own research, wheres the meaningful discussion gonna come from? What's to gain for someone sharing his or her insights if what they get in return are memes and uninformed statements.

But it's like that with all hypes and subs. So what I'll do is once I read up a bit I look for a more specialized approach. Maybe instead of all stocks ever, I look into Pennystocks. Learn a bit there, dig deeper. Maybe I like the idea of investing in Cannabis. Go from Pennystocks to Weedstocks. Discover there's multiple approaches to cannabis investing and move to CannabisMSOs. From there I pick my favorite MSOs and find subs just for those!

You are in the fortunate position of being able to afford to lose your investment and more importantly in a position to afford not investing, most people need to invest either to fund a pension or as an endowment.

Do not buy single stocks unless you are a professional, as a rule of thumb do not buy single stocks if you need or even feel like you want to ask people what stocks to buy. Always take profits when markets are overheated (you’ll know they are overheated because you’ll find people asking questions like you are on the internet)

I've learned a ton since I started months ago, but I still have a lot to learn, and it's hard to figure out whose information and advice to trust in your pursuit of information. For example, I can pull up all sorts of data about companies, their earnings reports, their P/E ratio, do some technical analysis on the stock's past performance, etc. But unless I have enough knowledge to understand all that data and make smart conclusions from it, my own DD isn't going to be trustworthy. I think that's why a lot of newbies end up on these subreddits: because we want confirmation and opportunities to learn from other people.

112,HUGE," This is simply not true. There are qualities that you'll probably take on, like ""Kids these days"" type shit, but that quality isn't something that defines boomers. That's just old people. 

The divide between Boomers and Millennials is as large of a generational divide as humanity has probably ever seen, simply because Boomers are the last generation to grow up without the internet. They existed before internet+smartphones+constant ability to just look stuff up.

It's a HUGE mentality swap. It's the reason why millenials and younger generations don't have the same huge gaps that millenials and boomers do. Sure, the generations below millenials are all distinct and unique, but they're all generations with the internet.

The internet is the single biggest societal driving factor humanity has ever faced, and boomers are the last generation to be on the other side of that wave.",thisisntarjay,1,/r/stocks/comments/mw0g9l/where_do_you_go_to_for_legit_stocks_discussions/gvg1gv6/,0.026,0.877,0.097,0.893

150,SIRI," personally would't recommend doing any of this. most of the stocks you mentioned its a waste of money and time. to debunk some things like investing in the company for 10 to 30 years its internet blog atraction. Companies like apple facebook etc... have weary limited potential to grow they already controlling a good part of the market and anti-monopoly law wont let them grow bigger. Also, you want to avoid companies like Tesla simply reason overvalued through the roof if you planing to scalp tesla is fine definitely not for a long keep. If you want to drop money and forget about the market my suggestion don't do it at all or invest in some hedge fund.

&#x200B;

On the other hand, you want to keep a portfolio of 10 companies in industries of your interest if you beginner I would recommend sticking with one industry master and expend in a year. My recommendation will invest in sp500 one industry keeps for 1 to 3 months if the position is losing money sell the stock and move your fund to winning positions don't close any winning positions as long you making money try to add more on winners. Before you invest in the industry or stock check what's happening in the sector if it's struggling or booming you can have expectations of what to wait for. 

&#x200B;

For example, Ford (F) looks really strong and I expect to see the stock at $14 to $16 . I bought it for $11 slowly going up to confirm that the company will rise to check PMI index and USA unemployment rates ford really volatile on these reports. The same applies to other companies like SIRI etc... 

Try to compare the SP500 index to see if stock dependant on actual index movement does the same to PMI or any other economic indicator that will help you track your stock if it's planing to go against your position or not.

224,IBM," I am one of the biggest IBM downers around but their latest earnings impressed me and I would buy them more as a bet on Krishna - IBM tends to get savior CEOs when they’re near death.

The bad is their stock price is about where it was 5 years ago and 10 years ago. I’d rather have a growing company. Their earnings have also been on a downward trend over the last few years so you can only get so much dividend out of that. 

In tech IBM cloud is a joke. They will not be able to compete long term against the hyperscale CSPs. I think that’s why Krishna is spinning off their infra business. I do think they have a future as a custom solutions provider that uses cloud.

Quantum is a long ways off, I’m pretty biased but I also don’t see IBM a winner in this category because - riddle me this, what was the last technology IBM grabbed by the horns and took a leading position in? It was mainframes under Lou Gerstner nearly 30 years ago. No way their more agile competitors are going to let quantum go to IBM. Just look at how they did with Watson.

Anyways, I personally don’t touch IBM and that is probably my internal biases working against me because I’m in tech. However, I genuinely have been impressed by Krishna so far.

For years CS has been lagging its European peers with the exception of Deutschebank (and has been miles behind its US peers) - and the solution of management is just to “take more risk”. It’s not like they even took smart risk either - these huge losses weren’t through doing anything exotic/exciting, in both the case of Greensill and Archegos they were basically just a lender.

Personally I just don’t see the appeal, unless management is completely gutted (starting with the CEO who threw Lara Warner under the bus, not that she was competent either).

I don’t think you’ll necessarily lose lots on CS - in reality I think it will either be a value trap that goes nowhere for years, or just bleeds out slowly over time.

Also, if/when Chime IPOs at/near rumored valuations then SoFi will look cheap with their bank charter coming.

A few I’m not buying right now, but are intriguing/haven’t seen mentioned would be Etoro (FTCV) & Grab (AGC). Both are similarly SPAC deals, and non US focused, so you’d have to be ok with that.

We are following up on the letter below that we sent you on March 3, 2021, describing the anticipated public offering regarding Social Finance Inc. As a reminder, if you take no action and continue to use our services, you will be deemed to have consented to the ownership change and assignment, and your accounts will remain with us following the closing of the Transaction, which we hope to be on or about April 9, 2021. 

Sincerely, 
John Gardner, 
GM, SoFi Invest


EDIT: 
Here is the top part of the first email they sent:

You are getting this letter because of the anticipated public offering of Social Finance, Inc. When this happens a change of control of SoFi Wealth LLC, with whom you are a customer, will occur but your experience will not change. The account management, management fees, service, and oversight will all remain unchanged. If you do not consent to this behind the scenes change related to our public offering, you can let us know within 30 days. 

Summary: 
This communication concerns the anticipated public offering regarding Social Finance, Inc. (the “Company”). The Company is a leading next-generation financial services platform, and has entered into a definitive agreement with Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. V (“SCH”) (NYSE: IPOE), a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company, to bring the major consumer-focused financial technology business to the public markets (the “Transaction”). A link to the Press Release is: 
https://www.sofi.com/press/sofi-plans-to-go-public. In connection with the anticipated offering, a registration statement has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and is currently under SEC review. There are no assurances when or if the SEC will make the registration effective. We hope, however, that the Transaction will close on or about April 9, 2021. 

The Transaction will result in a change of control of SoFi Wealth LLC and an “assignment,” as that term is used in the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and in your investment advisory agreement (your “Customer Agreement” or “SoFi Wealth Advisory Agreement, or “Financial Planning Agreement” or “Digital Advice Agreement” as applicable, and, together, “Agreement”) with us. In accordance with your Agreement, we are requesting your consent to this assignment in order to allow us to continue providing services to you following consummation of the Transaction.",hhh888hhhh,1,/r/stocks/comments/mvwape/best_fintech_stocks_to_invest_in/gver64r/,0.019,0.859,0.122,0.9931

365,GM," 22 year old investor here, i’ve made a lot of fuckin mistakes so here is what i’d say so you can avoid some suffering:

1. Pick companies you actually know, so you’re not just speculating price as your only logic to selecting the stock. Seriously, i’m dumb as hell and didn’t do this at first. You’ll lose money 9 times out of 10.

2. Don’t be hesitant investing in ETFs. It’s hard to beat the market. I think today is the only day in the last 3 months where my stocks have outperformed VOO (the only ETF in my portfolio).

3. Microsoft and Apple are good choices. Barring a market collapse, they’re almost ensured to increase in value. I wish i had those in my portfolio.

4. Pick sectors you believe in and know shit about. For example: I know a lot about the EV market through my job, so I own a lot of EV stocks and they’ve done wayyyy better than the rest of my portfolio. If you want EV stocks, go with Nio, Ford, GM, Tesla, or Stellantis. I own 3 of those, i won’t say which tho so you aren’t biased in case u wanna pick some EV stocks.

416,KRUS," Yea, its a publicly traded company. KRUS (Kura Sushi). Its basically the child of a major Japanese chain.

Not trying to advertise them, nor do I think the current share price is wonderful but here is my synopsis.

The idea is sushi delivered to you on a pair of magic carpets. 31 locations, and approaching rapid expansion phase.

One carpet is always moving and offering you various treats while the other delivers on demand when you do a special order. These are common in Japan and are also known as conveyor belt sushi restaurants. You gotta love the Japanese and their efficiency.

I like it because it has a immense competitive advantage by automating the serving process (less servers needed thus lower overhead). It also does the accounting all at the table. You slide your plates into this opening at the table, and it spits out your total. You can pay via phone app or using the touch device on the table though I am not sure those still exist due to covid.

The only thing you cant get without a server is drinks though there is water and green tea at the table.

So basically a near fully automated dine in experience. Imagine how much they save in salary. Thats a pretty big competitive advantage imho. Plus there are literally no other major sushi chains in the USA so the market is theirs to take. There are tons of ma and pa shops so there is competition, but no major chain. There is a reason for that.

Sushi is a notoriously difficult cuisine to serve. It requires a lot more training and better paid chefs and most of the time, they are customer facing. This is very hard to scale. But Kura does have experience already and it looks like they figured it out.

Customers seem to like it because of the experience. Gimmicky, but hey, sometimes a change is fun. Food is not bad either and prices are in line with any other hole in the wall so no reason not to go for it every now and then.

418,JP," Well mainly because banks and insurers aren’t going to grow exponentially, unlike (say) Tesla. Personally I quite like US banks and think they can grow a lot (and they make a ton of money) but there’s no way JP Morgan has a similar potential upside to Tesla or Square for instance.

An extreme example of this is Rocket - it makes an absolute ton of money right now, yet has a relatively mediocre valuation. The reason is mainly because its a mortgage lender - if the housing market softens or rates go up, their profits will drop significantly. Also there’s not a huge way for them to keep growing from here.

Not saying one is good and one is bad, it’s just  apples and oranges. Personally I think both tech companies and banks have their place in a portfolio",introspective79,1,/r/stocks/comments/mvus55/how_can_a_stock_selling_at_a_pe_of_75_with_a/gvhn9v1/,0.086,0.802,0.112,0.4316
419,AIG," >Well mainly because banks and insurers aren’t going to grow exponentially

Historically, non-growth companies (i.e., just growing at the rate of inflation, or what have you), would trade at a PE of 10-15. (P/E's are wacky now due to ultra-low interest rates.) This would give you a 7% - 10% earnings yield on your investment.

Banks and insurance companies would traditionally have P/E's that are even lower, giving you an even higher earnings yield. IIRC, during bear markets, banks and insurance companies can trade at P/E's of around 4, which would be about a 25% earnings yield!

I think that one of the reasons for these low valuations is that banks and insurance companies can be hit pretty hard when the economy is bad. And also, banks and insurance companies can sometimes go bankrupt virtually before anyone knows that anything is wrong, due to the complexity of their financial positions. Take Leamon Brothers and AIG, for example.",nessus42,1,/r/stocks/comments/mvus55/how_can_a_stock_selling_at_a_pe_of_75_with_a/gvhqg8a/,0.096,0.843,0.061,-0.7088
420,PEG," So, by your argument, Philip Morris is a great investment since its P/E is only 17, not 75. You've sold me.

Peter Lynch, btw, said nothing remotely like that you should buy S&P 500 index funds. He said that Wall Street is filled with sheep, and you can do much better than Wall Street by doing things like watching where your teenage children want to shop, etc.  


And I don't have any weird fixation on Amazon. I've merely used Amazon as an exemplar for when Lynch's PEG rule isn't the best rule to follow. They are a great exemplar because they are a counter-example for the growth stock model that is easy to understand. I.e., trading profit growth for revenue growth is sometimes a good idea, if a company can pull it off.  


My point is pretty simple, and yet you seem unable to comprehend it: The pitch that was made for PayPal was a completely canonical growth stock pitch. There are conventional methods of determining the value of a growth stock. My father-in-law made it rich, starting with only $5,000, using these methods.  


As I understand it, PayPal is not a good value according to traditional metrics for a growth stock. If it's more like Amazon or Tesla, then I'd like to hear that pitch, rather than the one that was made. Or if there is some reason why conventional growth stocks are suddenly worth four times as much as they used to be, then I'd like to hear that.  


But, during the dot com boom, I told my friend that it was time to get out since valuations were insane. He argued back that maybe the market had permanently changed and valuations would be considered completely differently going forward.

He recently told me that the biggest mistake of his life was not listening to me back then.",nessus42,2,/r/stocks/comments/mvus55/how_can_a_stock_selling_at_a_pe_of_75_with_a/gver3mf/,0.066,0.791,0.143,0.9405

Though clearly the market is distorted these days by historically low interest rates, which is causing asset inflation in both the stock market and in real estate.

Revenue growth stocks that plow all their earnings back into revenue growth clearly can't be evaluated  based on their P/E, since they have no profits. But I haven't heard anyone claim that PayPal isn't an earnings growth stock.

424,USA," Absolutely that is always covered in the income statement of financial releases. You can check their 10-Q (quarterly statement). This is usually available on the companies investors relation website and the stock brokers site. It breaks down their costs and profits but be aware that COVID borked a lot of calculations. 

These are then taken and inserted into various financial website databases so its usually easier to just look at the summaries on websites like yahoo finance or google finance or on your broker website. 

You will quickly notice that their profit margins are thin. Restaurants are usually that way but Kura is even lower than industry average though perhaps not sushi restaurants. The reason for this is food costs for sushi are higher than other cuisines hovering around 35% for Kura specifically. Pizza for example, is cheap to make and food cost is usually around 25%.

The food margin and labor costs for sushi are likely the reason why there are no chains in the USA. But this difficulty also gives Kura a huge advantage since they ""figured it out"" and allows them to grow unhindered (for now). Eventually economies of scale will come into play as well to increase margins.

Thats why I say this is a fun one to watch. Though its a simple business, its in a niche that no one else has done successfully in the USA.",thejumpingsheep2,1,/r/stocks/comments/mvus55/how_can_a_stock_selling_at_a_pe_of_75_with_a/gvhskmh/,0.046,0.814,0.139,0.9751

435,IP," I’ll give you Putin, that’s obvious.

But China invested a lot to get Trump out. While impossible to prove, it’s clear the amount of astroturfing and bot activity on social media that has now gone away.

Even excluding that, China suffered from the trade war. They devalued their currency intentionally as a gambit to hold out for a new president. This enabled them to not give into demands while still holding market share. Astroturfing on that front was everywhere. Claiming the US was losing and China was flourishing. Data did not back this up. Had Trump won and pushed the trade war further, China would not be able to survive their devalue scheme and would have to start ramping up trade/IP agreements. Despite what partisan news outlets led people to believe, Trump was winning the trade war. We saw a few industries decline domestically, but overall, US was on the right track.

Biden repeatedly mentioned repairing US-China relations and ending the trade war during his campaign. Media pushed this narrative of the trade war killing the country to support Biden’s campaign. Was China behind that? Who knows, but it’s quite clear China favored Biden.

The trade war was pretty much the only thing Trump got right. The corporate tax policy is *potentially* another one but that will require years to sift through to determine if it worked.

If a major correction or (pls no)crash happens you'll either have to buy back your options to sell your stocks and limit the damage or ride out the storm. Basically it comes down to risk tolerance and how comfortable you are riding the market for the foreseeable future.


Personally I only sell CCs that are 2-3 weeks DTE with <100% IV.

I’m not really understanding all the advice saying don’t sell if you believe in he company, just buy more. You can’t buy forever and at some point I do think selling makes sense to either take profit or redeploy. 

So if my shares get called I walk away happy with my profit and with free cash to redeploy. If my shares don’t get called I collect premiums and use those to buy stocks I have less confidence in. I don’t want to use premiums to buy 3 MS stocks.

473,TSLA," Yea I get what you're saying. If you already own the stocks and will gladly hold them until they hit your strike then there is no harm in making premium from CCs and looking at it as found money or using it to decrease your average. I think what I'm trying to say is you need to account for length of option vs premium recieved vs time and effort. Yes you can make 1k in premium from shares you already own, but why do all that work when you can get way more than 2% over 9 months in a regular old ETF? Or write one contract a week for a high IV stock that will net you 1k? Just my thoughts from everything I've learned over the years about options trading.

Your strategy works and more importantly it works for you, so keep doing what you're comfortable with and I wish you luck!

477,CS," Start with an amount of money that you dont mind losing. Then increase that a little to make sure that you take it seriously.

Start researching and buying individual stocks. Avoid funds. You will learn nothing if you invest in funds. Learn to buy individual stocks. Research their financials and sectors. Thats how you learn.

Books are nice, so feel free to read, but how do you know which book is good without frame of reference? You cant. Most business people are dolts and guess who writes books about investing? That would be people who arent particularly good at it. Thats why they write books... so they make money selling books instead. Someone really good at investing, is too busy making money doing it.

Invest in your own education. Learn it yourself. Once you understand the basics, the books become more valuable because you can at least gauge who is blowing smoke up your rear.

Recommended Order of Learning:

1. Simple stocks  
\- Businesses that are very easy to understand like food, retail, or basic manufacturing. Anyone can understand these without much education. This will teach you micro economics.
2. Financial Sector  
\- Slight more complex but instrumental to understand macro economics. You need to know this to get really good. Mainly know how banks work, both savings and investment banks and how they interact with government. This wont be easy but its very important.
3. Complex Stocks  
\- I highly recommend you go into sciences in college... because that is your intro to tech and biotech, both of which are highly profitable  IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING . I highly recommend you major in CS if you can for that reason, even if you dont intend to work in CS. You can do almost any business job with that major anyway.  
\- Learn about REITs. They are not hard, per se, but the way they make money is really weird due to depreciation. Their financial reports look wacky for that reason but this will teach you about real estate. This is an important sector.
4. Options  
\- This will teach you how to hedge. This is extremely important and what separates average from great. Buy some cheap calls/puts just to get some experience with them. Its ok if you lose... just dont sell calls/puts initially because that is risky.
5. Fixed Income  
\- you already got exposed them in the financial sector above. Just solidify it. Not so important these days due to stupid low interest rates but still important to the economy as a whole and you never know when they become profitable again.

HYLN, C3AI, PLTR, APPH, CRSP, BEAM, MAXN, FUBO(likely my most risk heavy). Also, I'm looking at multiple companies in all of these different sectors, but these are the ones I have personally come to that I have conviction in and believe in them for the next decade+. 

I think there will be multiple genomics stocks that do well, I think multiple solar stocks will also do well. EV is more speculative right now from what I gather.
