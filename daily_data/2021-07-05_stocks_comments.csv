82,TV," I draw the line at deliberately trying to make the world a horrible place.

Nike has been caught using child labor and underpaid labor because, like it or not, this kind of labor is normal in many parts of the world. It's easy to come in with the standards we have in the most developed nations and forget people elsewhere also have to eat and will take whatever job they can get. A 14 /yo in Pakistan taking a job at a shoe factory is just trying to bring home the bacon to a household that would otherwise not eat that night.

This is the same that happens with cheap Asian labor in many areas. China's economy has grown a lot in the last 20 years, but back when we first started exporting all our factory labor to China, it was the same deal, people working for wages near slavery for every American company moving their production to China. This is not because Americans forced quasi-slavery conditions, it's because the lives of those people were horrible and taking the factory gig for an American company was better than the other horrible options they had available. This is the reason we moved production to China in the first place, we found a place where people were so miserable that they would do anything just to eat.

So when you say ""factory X has been caught paying very little to workers and using a workforce of desperate people"", you are not describing American companies, you are describing what it is like to be a human in underdeveloped nations. And if you track through time, American factories in underdeveloped nations tend to grow the living standards there. Because they pay more and make a bit more of an effort. For instance, in China the [minimum wage has grown several times over](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/minimum-wages) since Americans first started moving in.

I'll stop there. I'm not defending any of these companies, I was just adding perspective because if you are going to bring morality into your business decisions then be sure you are looking at the whole picture and assessing the depth of the situation.

When it comes to tobacco companies, there is nothing redeemable. It's pure malicious greed from top to bottom. There was never a time since they started fighting legislation that they thought they had a good or even neutral product. They always knew they were selling something that hurts people, but the profits were good so they kept lying about it and greasing politicians to let them keep peddling this murdering product.

They knew that it's best to start people when they are too young to know better. So they ran a [campaign for decades](https://stopswithme.com/exposing-big-tobacco/smoking-in-the-movies/) to make sure cool figures in TV and movies were smoking on screen, to show teenagers that to be cool like the character on the screen you have to be a smoker. They deliberately targeted the youth so they could create loyal cancer-stick users. If you ask older smokers today, almost everyone will tell you a story of seeing this or that screen celebrity smoking and it made them want to try it. 1 out of 3 of those people have died of smoke-related disease.",Banner80,26,/r/stocks/comments/oe5dex/am_i_a_bad_person_to_invest_in_big_tobacco/h44zh7c/,0.101,0.798,0.101,-0.7042

US politicians get more votes for being tough on China and the Chinese are super nationalistic in their own right. Just seems like a brewing storm that would be best to see where it's headed first. 

However, if you're willing to accept this risk, then BABA is probably not a bad choice compared to other Chinese companies. I wouldn't consider touching others because the same risk applies and you always have to think about shady accounting practices (e.g. Luckin).",strikethree,2,/r/stocks/comments/oe82v7/is_baba_safe_stock_to_buy_with_510_years_outlook/h45wnzh/,0.054,0.845,0.101,0.899

162,PLTR," Find a company with strong resistance at the top and bottom. For a year, Netflix has been going from 480 to 540 back to 480 like clockwork (give or take 1-2%). If you want to swing trade, buy any time it dips below 490 and sell any time it gets to 530 (a safe margin of error in case it tops sooner). One day, it'll break above 550 and you'll miss out on those gains (no big deal since a gain is a gain). It may also drop below 480 (likely on really bad earnings), but you can safeguard against that with a stop loss at $470 to minimize your risk. I've been making 8% gains every few months on that stock specifically and will likely continue to do so into the future. You can play Netflix like me since I gave that example, but you can find plenty of choices that meet this criteria. Just stay away from speculative stocks like PLTR. They may have bands (PLTR goes from $18 to $23 then back to $18), but given the P/E, they're more likely to break the bottom and drop like rocks (forcing your stop loss) than break the top and fly (netting you some gains).

163,FB," Stay away from day trading. It's a nasty habit to pick up and most people aren't cut out for it. Swing tradings a lot less work and typically safer

My advice is:

* The best trading comes from companies that slowly go up long term, but trade ""flat"" over the medium term with stable tops and bottoms.  Amazon and mastercard are good examples of this right now. It's a common mistake to think that companies have to constantly be going up to make money, when the opposite couldn't be truer. You also can't go wrong with swing trading safer companies with lower volatility, especially when you're new. Those are the companies you can safely hold if things go south.

* Don't get married to a single stock. This is a rookie mistake. There's going to be plenty of moments where stocks just don't make sense to trade, typically when they're outside of a predictable trading range(such as breaking a support or resistance) or if it's just not at a good price within the trading range. Do not force trades that don't make sense because you think you need to trade constantly.

* Following that, sometimes you just have to say fuck it and take a stock out of your watchlist because it's no longer favorable to trade within your strategies. I just did that with HD and FB after their insane runups since I now have no idea what they'll be trading within and speculating that is a complete waste of my time for now. The market is always changing and favorable companies can and will become unfavorable.

* If you're trying to get 10% swings constantly you need to curb your expectations. 3-5% is much more reasonable and can be achieved faster as most stocks have +/- 1-3% volatility. Reliable profits always beat occasional large profits",TheRandomnatrix,3,/r/stocks/comments/odvztl/any_successful_day_and_swing_traders_howd_you_do/h45a1bc/,0.09,0.756,0.154,0.9731

165,DD," A lot of folks here have already put in some good advice. Swing trading is easier than day trading. Do DD, lots of it. Add them to your watchlist and watch to see when it dips. On days when they have dips, buy and hold. When you want to take profits, sell. I set my rule as 30% or more total gain and sell. Micro ND small cap companies are easy for swing trading but very volatile that you have to track every day. If you buy large cap companies, choose companies with a lot of volume and volatility. I have a few companies I hold for bigger gains for lottery like momentum stocks. Be very careful buying shares out of FOMO. Biggest mistakes I make are when I go chase a stock after selling and seeing it rocket. The rocket always seem to fall the very next day and continue downtrend for a week until it goes up again.

AMD has been gunning and bringing out faster CPUs ever since. Initial 2 year WS tried to manipulate AMD by publishing negative articles and kept the peice low to around $16 up to 2018 but they could not supress it further.

It shot up in 2019 and 2020 and probably will cross $100 soon. INTC on other hand has become obsolete. Pushing the same gimmick of talking more and delivering less.

AMD has been gunning and bringing out faster CPUs ever since. Initial 2 year WS tried to manipulate AMD by publishing negative articles and kept the peice low to around $16 up to 2018 but they could not supress it further.

It shot up in 2019 and 2020 and probably will cross $100 soon. INTC on other hand has become obsolete. Pushing the same gimmick of talking more and delivering less.

They changed their CEO but nothing has changed in 6 months. I recently sold my INTC positions of 1000 shares (bought at $35 sold at $58). I am still holding AMD 4000 shares ($14 avg).

206,AMD," >People often just look at gaming setups and then compare that to a fall off for Intel

Intel's server processors are also losing in competition with AMD's Epyc. if you think Intel is only losing in the gaming market then you have no idea what you are talking about. They are losing the battle in the gaming and server market. They have completely lost the battle in the mobile market and their Atom CPU was a spectacular failure. They're losing Amazon's AWS (the biggest cloud computing service). And recently they've lost Apple. 

The world is slowly moving towards ARM architecture and Intel is the only big company that still ignores this market. In my opinion, it's just a matter of time when they start working on their own ARM processors. The problem is that competitors already working on it or already have working ARM CPUs. 

Another problem is that Intel manufactures processors itself. This sounds good in theory, but in practice, the cost of switching to a new architecture will be huge for them. Intel has already made the decision not to manufacture processors itself in the future, but it won't happen tomorrow.

Looking at net income alone is terribly short-sighted. ARM revolution is about to start and AMD server 2gen CPUs were introduced fairly recently, in 2019.

\*\*\* Amazon ( $AMZN ) \*\*\*

""It would make more sense for AMZN to acquire a regional drug retailer like RAD to quickly establish a physical presence.""  
  
Also, it should be noted that there is already a partnership existing between Amazon and Rite Aid since July of 2019. Rite Aid was the first partner that Amazon selected for its retail in-store pick-up program called Amazon Counter. Here is the link for the launch of the program:

So the companies are already coordinating some business activities to a minor extent.  
  
Finally, with the acquisition of Bartell Drugs, Rite Aid became the #1 retail pharmacy in Seattle, WA. Should Amazon buyout Rite Aid, AMZN itself would be able to cut out the middleman and provide cost effective prescription drug benefits to its 75,000 employees at the Seattle headquarters.  
  
\*\*\* Walmart ( $WMT ) \*\*\*  
  
Walmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategic growth target for the company. However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens. In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale. If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over. WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.  
  
A couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:  
  
Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions thereby lowering its overall drug cost, improving profitability  
  
All the goods sold in the front-end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products Walmart sells in its own department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.  
  
Based on the above 2 points, Walmart would improve both its own existing margins and at the same time would improve those of the Rite Aid revenue through such an acquisition.  
  
The Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.  
  
If you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $4 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels. So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2-3 year payback on the investment.  
  
Whichever company, Walmart or Amazon, utlimately decides to buy Rite Aid, that corporation will instantly become the #3 retail pharmacy in the USA, and will be well-positioned to someday challenge CVS and Walgreens for the #1 or #2 spots.  
  
\*\*\* Walgreens ( $WBA ) \*\*\*  
  
Another darkhorse in this whole race is Walgreens. This week, Walgreens completed the sale of its Alliance Healthcare businesses to AmerisourceBergen for $6.5 billion (---see link below this paragraph). This windfall gives WBA the needed funds to finally finish the takeover of Rite Aid that it started back in 2015. While that deal was ultimately blocked by the courts, no judge could reasonably claim today that there is insufficent competition to support consumers if the balance of Rite Aid was taken over by Walgreens (NOTE: WBA bought 1,900+ RAD stores in 2018, and RAD currently has 2,500+ stores remaining).

Also, it should be noted that there is already a partnership existing between Amazon and Rite Aid since July of 2019. Rite Aid was the first partner that Amazon selected for its retail in-store pick-up program called Amazon Counter. Here is the link for the launch of the program:

So the companies are already coordinating some business activities to a minor extent.  
  
Finally, with the acquisition of Bartell Drugs, Rite Aid became the #1 retail pharmacy in Seattle, WA. Should Amazon buyout Rite Aid, AMZN itself would be able to cut out the middleman and provide cost effective prescription drug benefits to its 75,000 employees at the Seattle headquarters.

Walmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategic growth target for the company.

If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over. WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.

Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions thereby lowering its overall drug cost, improving profitability

232,RAD," The pandemic makes looking at the 5% decline in Pharmacy Services business a bit more convoluted, but I think it certainly surprised some folks, as did the wider than expected $0.79 per share loss guidance in fy21. My point is I don’t see evidence of a turnaround, despite management efforts over the past couple years. The hope for a RAD turnaround is not a new story.

233,IMO," why do you think they need to triple their presence? they're upgrading all of their stores with new designs to improve the customer experience, acquired Bartell drugstore to become the #1 pharmacy in Seattle, and repositioned their PBM to compete in the midmarket. Also they're about to turn profit, its not like they're deep in losses (only -$13M last quarter, that's measly an extra $5K in pure profit from each stores in the quarter.). I know it doesn't work this way but I wanted to show how close they are. All of these tell me its a good buy, the bearish sentiment has gone a bit too far and that makes it even a more attractive buy IMO.",sparty1983,1,/r/stocks/comments/odtlcj/please_poke_as_many_holes_as_you_possibly_can_in/h44goda/,0.028,0.859,0.113,0.8906
234,CVS," Drug stores can't multiply profits easily. They develop growth by developing locations. The only thing that gets this company out of the hole is a huge expansion. To accomplish that they would need to create a value proposition for the public that's at least as attractive as Walgreens and CVS, and can compete with grocery store, Wal-mart, and Costco pharmacies.

This feels way more like Sears than like a company with a chance of shedding its baggage.

235,WMT," Wall Mart is particularly good in the US due to it's massive logistics network and economies of scale. Due to this they are the low cost supplier, which creates their moat. 

Low-cost suppliers are recession-resistant. WMT increased its revenue during 2008 and the Covid crash. 
 
This makes entering new markets somewhat hard as it doesn't have the economies of scale in those areas. Prepare for a ton of capex. Achievable, but not without serious investment and time. 

That said, I am bullish. I think WMT offering cheap insulin and their healthcare expansion, the growth of their online store, switch to automation, 0.7 p/s, dividend, and long track record of stability and supior mgmt; make WMT one of the best safe plays in a historically pricey market. WMTs expansion into India and their acquisition of Flipkart seem smart, but I doubt they will create much of a meaningful catalyst to a company already selling $560b of consumer goods to more prized markets.",msnebjsnsbek5786,15,/r/stocks/comments/odw1de/wmt_undervalued_with_their_expansion_into_india/h43az99/,0.049,0.751,0.2,0.9828

My local store had super nice 'pick up tower' at the entrance where you just scanned your app and an automated system delivered your your online order in seconds.  That's now been shut down as hardly anyone used it.  Which is mind boggling.

339,DD," Since you like ETFs you should check out this strategy I came up with cuz I'm kinda in the same boat and I smoked some good weed last night.

I figured a good way to find stocks is to search through an ETF.  The ETF chose these stocks for certain reasons right.  Then you can find specific ones you like and research them more.  Compare numbers with other companies in the ETF.  Search maybe small or micro cap ETF.  this is like your gold mine play.

340,DD," It's not irrelevant.

P/E on it's own means nothing. It's all about comparing it to similar companies. When valuating a company, looking at it's own P/E is pointless, you have to compare that P/E to similar companies, then more importantly, compare that company's financials to similar companies financials.

It doesn't matter if tech has a 200x P/E and banks have a 5x P/E... they have totally different operations. If 200 is normal for tech then 200 is normal for tech. It doesn't matter. What matters is that it's the norm. 

If company 1 has a higher P/E than company 2's P/E, that doesn't mean company 1 is over valued and it doesn't mean company 2 is under valued. What if company 1 has a better balance sheet, or company 2 isn't showing much growth. What if they're both way higher than the other 10 comparable companies.

DD isn't a cookie cutter process. It depends on the sector, company, business model, stage of growth, etc. 

Things I typically look at include financials, management, bond prices, dependency on external factors (other companies or commodities)... it's not about what you do or don't look at... you should be looking at EVERYTHING. Nothing is too small to look at.

If you're looking for a killer growth stock, you should know every little thing about the company. You should use their product/service (if possible). If it's public information, you should know about it.",CltCommander,2,/r/stocks/comments/odzdq6/how_much_due_diligence_should_i_do/h459c7y/,0.059,0.894,0.047,0.0565
341,DD," no problem! If you're just getting started, learning to read fins are very important. Start with the balance sheet, move onto the income statement. 

A balance sheet is like a snapshot of the companies financials. It doesn't tell you how much they are making or anything about their growth, but it tells you how much they have in cash, assets, and debt. It's one of the first things I look at because right away, if you see a company with 5m in debt and 500k in assets and 20k in cash, obviously thats a shit company that has almost no chance of paying off their debt. It's an easy way to weed out unhealthy companies so you don't have to waste your time with further DD.  

If the balance sheet looks good, move on to their income statement. This will tell you about their growth, and profit on their sales. 

The Cash Flow will tell you about where the money is coming from. Companies can earn money from their operations, from investments, or from raising money by issuing shares. If a company is constantly issuing shares to raise money, that can be bad for investors as their shares are getting diluted. Sometimes it's necessary and can lead to faster growth. This is something you need to decide. 

Once again you have to consider what the company does and what stage it in. It's totally normal for very early businesses to not be turning a profit. You just have to make sure they don't get into too much debt and are in control and on the right path to achieve goals. You have to treat companies differently depending on what stage it's in, and what sector it is in.",CltCommander,2,/r/stocks/comments/odzdq6/how_much_due_diligence_should_i_do/h45bcxs/,0.099,0.748,0.153,0.9345
342,DD," honestly everything you need is online for free, you just need to look for it. 95% of investing is just research. Step 1 is to research how to become and investor (learning about the things I mentioned). Youtube how to read a balance sheet. Maybe you'll have to go thru a couple vidoes before you find a channel that suites your learning style, but that's part of the research process...

You're going to become such a research god after all this you'll stop thinking ""I don't understand what that guy said"" and you'll instead think ""I can just quickly google this"". 

Something that's user friendly for beginners is TradingView. Sign up for a free account. Click on ""Chart"". Pull up a company, and scroll down on the right side until you see ""more financials"". It will open another page and you can see the income statement, cashflow, and balance sheet from there. If you click on any of the items under one of those categories, it will compare them in a chart at the top. I would just send you a link, but it won't work because of how the site is built. TradingView has a good layout and it helps beginners a lot. 

It's a ton of shit to learn at first but just stick with it and you'll be a pro soon enough. It's going to take you weeks to DD your first company, then you'll be down to a couple hours in no time. 

Keep a list in front of you of stuff you want to learn about, and slowly check it off. Every time someone say something that you don't understand, add it to the list. Every time you learn about 1 new thing, you're going to find 5 other things you need to learn about. It's normal, just don't get frustrated. 

I like to think of a company as garbage until proven otherwise. Don't try and tell yourself that the company is good. Tell yourself it sucks and let the numbers prove you wrong. As soon as I see a red flag, I toss that company and move on. 

Something you should do is pull up 2 similar companies. Compare coca-cola and pepsi for example. They basically do the same thing, but check out how different their financials are, and therefore different P/E. Good example of how different companies can take different routes with the same product. The more you learn about reading fins the more you'll see how different the two actually are.",CltCommander,1,/r/stocks/comments/odzdq6/how_much_due_diligence_should_i_do/h45iuzx/,0.047,0.866,0.087,0.9455

But I can’t allocate so much of my portfolio in this company vs a FB/AMZN/GOOG (where I get growth, balance sheet safety, and moat)

From here, if you want to get in on the action. You have to believe they do a few things…
1) surprise HEAVILY on revenue growth and forward guidance
2) grow more into their cyber security suite of tools beyond just basic stuff like their widely used DDOS prevention (a ton of websites use them for this) and firewall 
3) Content delivery network investment trend continues and profit margins aren’t competed away with bigger boys entering the game (ie GOOG, MSFT, AMZN)
4) website speeds overwhelmingly determine ranking on google and mobile searches
