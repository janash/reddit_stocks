13,HPE," Oh, yes they do, with several on the current Top500-list.

But fuck they do it weirdly. Let's not use industry standard 19"" racks, instead let's build some weird metal thing with pipes. Oh, and as for interconnect, obviously a fucking 37-dimentional hypercube, cuz normal non-blocking fat tree topologies are for poor people.

If the design was based on intel's roadmap, you not only get glorious performance (on paper), you'll also actually get the machine on time (on paper). 

As everyone else is using Infiniband and has been for the past decade, it's obvious that your next supercomputer should use HPE Cray HPC Slingshot ™. All the benefit and performance of Mellanox, *and* a slightly smaller support matrix. And as for storage, HPE got you covered! Just make sure you get it ""HPE HPC CraYyy™""-branded, to ensure you get the good stuff. If it's only ""HPE""-branded, you are poor people and get to enjoy HPEs ""value add"" in all your firmware, originally from reputable brands.

Remember how I read all the automotive news. My options were basically Camaro/Mustang or keep my lowly Chevy Beretta (which was a decent car TBH).

But I CAN still work.... so I do because I get bored - and people pay me very well for my time.

On top of that while I work for these people who pay me, sometimes I take phone calls from other people who pay me to answer their questions as needed so they can pay someone less experienced less money to do most of their work without having to pay someone like me full time when they only need me once a week for 20 minutes

I've noticed that in the states there's a HUGE difference between most countries in Europe. Over here the goal is for people to work DESPITE disability and provide levels of adaptation and treatment that allows for that. Examples being ergonomic solutions, adapted work schedule, selected work tasks, physiotherapy, orthotics and so fourth.

I'm a Swede myself, you'd have a snowball's chance in hell to get disability by the sound of it.

the economy is slowing down, but stonks are pretty much fully detached from the economy at this point, and are pretty detached from company performance as well, earnings dont even matter anymore, they are basically fueled by hype",dbgtboi,18,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1272mci/big_short_investor_congratulates_market_dip/jecs0dz/,0.128,0.739,0.133,0.5414

no what you likely are doing is going and buying a CD at 5% or putting it in some 3.5% - 4% savings account at a big bank

If you arent buying it here, at the bottom of that range, personally I think you're a moron populist who just wants to see the banks fail bc that plays into your doomer philosophy.

82,OP," It looks to me like the one given by u/erickssm just shows total bank deposits directly over time, which trends upward with a sharper jump in 2020 reflecting the increased savings during the pandemic with a mild downward trend in 2022.

The one given by OP shows “change in bank deposits from peak” and if the top of the graph is 0 but the actual amount of deposits trends up, that must mean it’s dynamically considering the peak as it updates over time rather than the peak considering the entire data set. So even though this chart shows 0 from 2020 to 2022, what’s really going on is the peak is sharply rising, so then the sharp downfall looks way more dramatic because the way the graph is structured strongly emphasizes decreasing deposits while abstracting increasing deposits.",thefutureisnotset,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/127ifsn/no_really_were_doing_fine_every_bank_right_now/jeeqy9u/,0.0,0.924,0.076,0.8225

And yeah, a lot of TA is bullshit, but just remember it's a self-fulfilling prophecy, and if algos and traders are buying in on momentum, it will go up. REGARDLESS of economic fundamentals, algos will trade it and push the market higher.

I think everybody should be ready to jump quick, though. This might be a good ""sell in May"" year...

115,NVDA," Lol this guy. Okay for the 100th time…. 

1.The market isn’t the economy. It is a bunch of people buying and selling companies. Some of these companies don’t care that rates are up or there’s a recession because they don’t make money off of you. They make money off of the world as a whole or large companies like them.

2. If you keep buying puts, the mms are going to keep propping up the larger market because they love your free money.

3. And this is a very important one to understand. Did you not live through 2021 and 2022?! Where were you when apple, Amazon, NVDA, Boeing etc all lost over half of their value. The market had a mass correction. Everyone took their profits and let the market drop. Then when you were sucking your thumb and crying to your wife’s boyfriend that you keep losing money and the market should go down, every non regard was piling cash into these huge companies!!! And every MM was piling their billions of retirement managed accounts into the market. You missed the market recession. The market low is always before a recession.we are now in a recession. And that means that the economy is shifting in order to get us out of a recession. So the market is pricing in that in a year or two, everyone will look back and say what a time to invest.

If you have any further questions then please research the market during 2008-2011. Market collapse. Economic collapse. Market rebound. Economic recession. Market starts a bull run, economy exits recession.

117,AAPL," I've been buying positions since March 6.

Few other things:

\-markets in the past have gone up while interest rates are high. the market doesn't HAVE to go down in correlation.

\- Markets are forward looking about 9 months so arguably, the market falling all 2022 was us pricing in the recession and markets are bidding for post rate hikes. If you have been listening to financial media for the past year this has been the most talked about, most anticipated recession ever. It has already been priced in literally.

121,AI," Generally speaking big tech should perform poorly in higher interest rate environments. There was a dizzying yield curve inversion. 
From what I heard on Bloomberg this morning  the Nasdaq 100 broke into bull market territory, 
Which leads to FOMO. Even crazier bitcoin has been the best performing asset in since its 2022 lows. 
For whatever reason there has always been a correlation between bitcoin and tech stocks. 
We’ve never seen such massive inflows into money market funds there’s been the past few weeks. 
Treasury secretary Yellen has expressed concern that the recent massive inflows into MM$$ funds could put additional stress on banks. This is already adversely affecting regional lenders. 
Reverse repo facility of the fed is averaging about 
$2.3 trillion daily levels. Bank runs are nothing new . Also the massive volatility in bond markets has led investors into safety plays like big tech (think good balance sheets) . Microsoft and apple have never taken up this much of the s&p 500 index together as right now. There’s another big driver here- the AI hype - chat GPT Open AI etc …now all the semis are rallying as sentiment around big tech has basically flip flopped back to the belief that companies who have the capability will  potentially offer a cloud based version of larger scale AI which they might offer as subscription . 
It’s like an Arms race pun intended . The recent NVIDIA and intel conferences have pushed the FOMO envelope even further. 
Tbh I’m kinda shocked at michael burry , I think he is a brilliant investor and people like him and mike Wilson of Morgan Stanley are really good at understanding macro driving market forces.  We all want to make Bank, but don’t get torched again bc of the expectation that markets will keep going up.  Mike Wilson is betting on the China reopening play. Makes sense- think about how markets rallied after the Covid dip of Q1 2020.

There is already liquidity concerns, and the Fed has stated they will likely hike rates again as they want to focus on their dual mandate and really crush inflation. Chair Powell even said a few months back that they were willing to send the country into a recession, if it would help to bring inflation back down to 2%. Also the federal reserve’s favorite benchmark of PCE (excludes energy and food prices) showed that inflation is beginning to cool. Up 4.6% (February 2023 vs 2022 YoY). We also saw that inflation in Europe has cooled in some areas one of the primary ones was lower energy costs.

""Honestly, who the fuck is bullish right now?"" The context is in a recent time frame. Bulls being overly optimistic has been a recurring joke for a year, and yet no display of self awareness seems to dawn upon them. Yeah, over a long timeframe of course stocks will go up, but that doesn't confirm markets will turn bullish all of a sudden. Though the entirety of 2022, bulls have been adamant in their condescension towards skeptics that stocks would go up. Well, the loss porn has been amazing to behold lol.

168,NVDA," tbh, I think this only works with inefficient markets like day trading small caps expecting an offering. You would have alot of time to get into a larger position in large caps unless you're expecting NVDA to drop like 50% in a day or the overall indices to limit down everyday and be halted. In any other situation, you would make more money trading with the herd, trend trading, etc because larger institutions move markets.",Bae_Sremmurd,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12736ha/expecting_another_41004150_run_before_another_spy/jeejtm5/,0.028,0.907,0.066,0.4404

Cash is losing value at the rate of about 1.5% a month (REAL world inflation #s, not the BS the liars are pushing! Buying power of $US is down, cost of EVERYTHING is going up) Gold is holding steady, or going up as a result.  Crazy inflation = paper money no good. (I was in Zimbabwe in 2008, when 3 apples cost 500,000 Zim dollars - due to essentially free for all money printing.  I saw a 500 million note - worth about ONE USD, at the time!)  REAL shit - gold, silver, platinum, oil, eggs, corn etc... to the MOON! (Oddly, Crypto somehow fits into the 'real shit' category, even though it's just as 'real' as the USD.)  Money goes where it's treated best.  Cash sitting in the bank is losing value every day, while Gold is up 10% in the last month.  Would you rather start this month with 100k, and finish with 110k, or 98.5k?  I have LEAPS for Jan, I bought last year, on gold stocks that are below limits to name here.

316,IRS," The above states that you bought 2,187,608.44 in securities and sold them for a loss at 2,121,495.69. If you did not have any wash sales, then this would yield a loss of 2,121,495.69 - 2,187,608.44 = -66,112.75 Wash sales are treated as additional profit and therefore decrease the net loss. Thus, the net loss you are eligible to claim is -66.112.75 + 61,492.95 = -4,619.80 Unfortunately, this is above the 3,000 maximum per year that you are allowed to claim. You should be able to carry, the remainder of the loss forward to next year.

As others have stated, a wash sale occurs whenever you sell a security for a loss, but then repurchase it within 30 days. In these cases, the amount of the loss from the sale is applied to your new cost basis and is treated as a profit for tax purposes. For e.g., if you purchased 100 shares of a stock at $5 for $500, sold them for a $200 loss at $3 a share, and repurchased 100 shares at $1 a share for $100 within 30 days of the sale, you will not be able to claim the initial $200 loss. Instead, your cost basis on the 100 shares purchased will be $100 + $200 = $300 or $3 per share. Only once you sell those shares, will you be able to realize the loss based on the adjusted cost basis.

That said, you clearly do a lot of trading. As such, you should probably consider using a broker that allows specific share identification for shares sold. The IRS assume that if you do not specifically identify shares sold, that you are selling them in a FIFO (First In First Out) method. For e.g., if you buy 100 shares at $5, then buy 200 more shares at $2, and sell 200 shares at $3, the IRS will assume that you sold the initial 100 shares bought at $5 with 100 shares bought at $2 which would yield a net profit/loss of -$100. If you were specifically identifying shares sold, you could sell 33 shares from the 100 bought at $5 with 67 shares bought at $2 for a $1 profit. Note: with the FIFO method, you would incur a wash sale if you bought some more shares later.",Competitive-Bag-6782,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/127af3d/can_someone_help_me_understand_my_taxes_as_an/jeet799/,0.056,0.777,0.167,0.9929

343,PSN," How is it misinformation? You can still use banks, but once you remove cash, it is now off the ""grid"" if you will. The only thing that tracks the money is the system. You scream ""misinformation"" because you won't admit that you were wrong. 

I try to never buy things that can be tracked. If I'm buying something online I'll even buy gift cards to do it, like PSN cards. Obviously if you register a car or buy a house, it's going on the record in other ways, but that's not cash's fault. I remember when I bought my last Jeep I bought in an envelope of cash, but they convinced me to save money through some shady banking and when they ran my SSN, they couldn't find any record of me. They said they only see that with people who have been in jail for 10 years.

344,OP," I'm not saying the cash is for that scenario. I was refuting the OP and their claim that no dominant currency is anonymous.

Like I said the end of the world currency is definitely bullets. Post WWI Germany, during the hyper inflation, many used bullets as currency. Just make sure you store the most common rounds.",NRA-4-EVER,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1276ml4/lecture_one_currency_master_class_101_fiat_gold/jed4p84/,0.037,0.838,0.126,0.6486

347,QSR," I don't really understand how waiting 30 minutes for a coffee is somehow a sign of a healthy company to you?

I live in Denver and I can assure you that Dutch Bros has numerous unhappy employees and even more unhappy customers. They're a far reach from what they once were and will end up no differently than any every other brand that forgot its roots. 

Their new buildouts are like 5 times the size of their original builds, their original builds were supposed to be a part of their brand. 

I'm not debating that the company will grow because obviously it will. The Dutch Bros you see 5 years from now will be nothing like the Dutch Bros that people loved and supported to get it to where it is today though. There are few QSR brands (if not absolutely zero) that stuck to their brand standards throughout their growth.",Neither_Ride3473,12,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/127dwsn/a_safe_150_gain/jedrgob/,0.062,0.786,0.152,0.9107
348,DD," No risk!  150% return!

I've never been to one that didn't have cars in the drive thru!  

...that's some rock solid DD there, OP.  You do know they lost $4 million on $750 in revenue last year, right?  When do you think Dutch Brothers will be profitable?  You know these guys have been around since '92 right?  This isn't some new growth start up with new technology or some groundbreaking product.  It's a god damn coffee shop.  

They have had some nice revenue growth but how much more market share is out there with Starbucks, Tim Hortons, fucking Dunkin Donuts, etc all selling their version of the same shitty black liquid caffeine sauce.

353,DB," I also like that to own a franchise you have to work as a manager for 2 years.  New stores open and so far all have been immediately profitable.  Due to the fact owners know their business. 

I had a friend who wanted to buy a DB. He has a lot more money than me…. He offered a lot of money,  they would not sell to him,  regardless of investment or cost,  unless he worked,  at age 55 for them from the bottom up.  That kind of thing is very rare and creates a team that not only is well trained,  but has heart.  

I just truly think it’s safer than gold to put your money with them.",Turbulent_Reporter40,-3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/127dwsn/a_safe_150_gain/jedqwun/,0.012,0.859,0.129,0.9122
354,QSR," No one uses Yelp. Wait times are far from mutually exclusive with high demand. 

99% of unhappy customers do not complain, they just don't return.  Dutch Bros also doesn't belong to the generation of people that make public complaints on things like Yelp, Google Maps, etc. 

Younger adults are far less likely than older adults to actually complain about a visit to a QSR. The price point and availability of competitors isn't worth the time it takes to complain.  Especially when you're referring to something like a coffee shop where there is 1,000,000 others that you can visit.",Neither_Ride3473,11,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/127dwsn/a_safe_150_gain/jedvkr2/,0.101,0.78,0.119,0.2415
