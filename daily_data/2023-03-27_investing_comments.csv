As far as flipping, that works better on TV than real life.  I sold my first house to a guy for $20k   He sold it the next year for $80k.  Sounds great right?   Well, except if he'd had contractors do all the work to it, based on the quotes I had, it'd have cost well more than $60k to do the work.     From the price of materials, I figure the guy made about $10-15 /hour working part time for a year doing a lot of hard work.   Roughly what a guy working for a contractor would get.     

I  bought a house in 2013, like the bottom of the market.    I have had it rented out since then.     Looking at recently solds around it now, it's easily worth double.   Doing a regression analysis on SPY, if I'd put the same money in SPY, it'd have doubled plus 40%.    Even considering what I've collected rent, SPY is still  at least 10% more money.    Renting it out, last year I made a 2% dividend on that money.   If things went well, and I got all the rent I asked for, I'd be getting 4%, which is the same return as a CD.  That kind of return is par for the course.   Housing as an investment has a low return for a lot of risk.   

Buying a house to live in is about reducing your rent by half in 30 years when you finally get it paid off and only have to pay taxes, insurance, and maintenance.

4,COST," Get that whole idea about flipping houses and shit out of your mind, that is the precise toxic mentality that caused the housing costs to jump so much in your area. You sound like a smart guy, so I'm going to ask plainly:

Does it really make sense to you that the value of a home/housing, on average, should outpace inflation? Because that's really what it comes down to when people start talking about their homes being an ""investment"" or a money maker. It's actually really annoying to see people complain about how housing has gotten so expensive and out of hand and then talk about how they hope to make bank on their current/future house in the same breath.

Buying a home is a housing COST, same as renting an apartment. Buying a house should net you stability, security, and the pride of ownership if you are the type that likes to have control over your space. It comes at the cost of opportunity and flexibility. Renting is the flip side to that - you have less stability and security because you ultimately do not own the space you're living in, but you gain flexibility and opportunity. You can actually invest your cash in assets that grow faster than a house would. If you decide there is are better opportunities elsewhere you can just up and move rather than pay a 6% penalty on the value of your house or pay for the opportunity cost of managing the rental. The rent you pay isn't ""giving your money away to someone else"", it's what you pay for housing. Let's say you pay $1200 in rent now - that needs to cover principle and interest, property taxes, maintenance, repairs, and maybe even some utilities depending on your situation. At today's rates you will be hard pressed to find a house where you can get all that for $1200 unless you're moving out to someplace with a completely different cost of living.

Note that I'm in no way against buying a house. We got one not too long ago right before the rate hikes started. Our house is ""worth $60-100k less"" than when we bought it depending on which bullshitter real estate website you want to believe, largely due to the rate hikes. I guarantee you the housing prices were your at are likely lower than what you think if you actually go out there and start looking at what's actually selling and what's been up for 2-3+ months. On our part we enjoy having a place to call our own and I like having a garage as well as greenspace/a yard. We are not here to ""make money"", it's a lifestyle choice.

Given that, there's nothing ""wrong"" with waiting. Prices WILL come down given the rates, but by how much is anybody's guess. Unless there's a massive crash and you live in a highly speculative area, the drop in property prices will take time. By the same token if rates start dropping again then housing prices won't drop as much. We played a game for maybe 4 years where we were thinking that maybe the bubble will pop or whatever. If I were you I'd think long and hard about WHY you want a house. If it's to make money then you might as well buy a multi-unit and live in it while renting out the others. If your goal is NOT to be a landlord then reconsider why you want a property if the goal is not just to live in it the way you want.",Zanna-K,2,/r/investing/comments/123m9b6/ive_got_25k_ready_to_buy_a_house_but_im_going_to/jdwq3jg/,0.06,0.814,0.125,0.9896

Price could fluctuate, but I just don't see that happening in the 'starter home' market anywhere.

Your primary residence, IMO, is not an investment. It is your home. Unless you trade DOWN in size or location, you will always need about the same amount of money to have the same amount of house in a similar location. Your house value increases (without doing crazy work), so did other houses.

Even if your house price drops over the next year, it will probably increase in 3-5.

21,OP," Real estate prices move slow.   The mortgage crisis happened in 2008, prices didn't bottom out until 2012 or so.

If I wanted to sell my house now, I'm going to look at what the neighborhood houses sold for in the last 6 months, and start there, leaving it on the market for a few months hoping for that pent up demand to snatch it up, waiting at least 3 months to drop the price.   Then, if the buyer is using a mortgage, it's another 6 weeks until I get my money.    

That is months, vs. my stocks, I could sell my whole portfolio within seconds, so the daily price is more of a thing vs. yearly for houses.    I see the prices of stocks coming back in 2-3 years, but at the same time the houses will be at or closer to the bottom, which is why I advise to put the money in stocks.

I think it will take 2-3 years for house prices to bottom out, and then if it starts rallying, it'll be another 2-3 years at least for it to start rallying and getting back to the same level.     That would be a  short peak to peak historically.  

I'd take cash for a house before I took an offer for someone that needs to get a mortgage.   The more cash OP has, the better position they'll be in if they do get to a multiple offer scenario, but I don't know that it will be that crazy again for a while.   Time is his friend as he doesn't have a strict timeline.  He can wait for the good deal, the friend of a friend looking to avoid the realtor commission,  the perfect house, etc. 

For a house I was involved with, bought in 2007  it wasn't until 2019 that it was back to the same price that it could be sold without bringing money to closing to cover what was owed vs. what it could sell for.

I’ll entertain your hypothetical. $25k down payment, enough for a $125,000 property at 20% down. The average home price in the US is $460,000. Okay fine, we won’t put 20% down, adding risk and now PMI which will cut into return. Let’s say we will put 10% down then on a $250,000 property, still almost half of what the average home is selling for which likely means it’s older or in a less valuable location. Fine. In your example you are essentially arguing for investing with leverage and your point seems to be you’ll be getting 4% return (where did that even come from?) on a $100k house (good luck finding that) vs a 6.5% interest rate is a -2.5% net return. Negative $2500 expected return vs positive $1000 GUARANTEED return. What are YOU even talking about?

29,FACT," >You can withdraw your funds from a treasury bill by re-selling it ahead of maturity but you could either make or lose money on that.

right and that is the problem. it is not a risk-free return unless you hold until maturity and if you hold until maturity, it is not liquid, YOU CANT WITHDRAW TREASURY BONDS. This means you need a higher interest rate in bonds than savings to justify the risk and illiquidity which currently, it doesn't justify.

>The other downside of a savings account is that interest rates can rapidly drop.

right, but you can withdraw it at any time without risk to invest in something else, unlike treasury.

>Bottom line: you can choose to do whatever you want with your money. If you feel a savings account is your best option go for it. I’m not trying to convince you otherwise.

The problem is that YOU do not control them. So if in the future, you want more growth oriented funds in your portfolio and less bonds, you wouldn't be able to make that switch easily.

37,AI," I work with AI/ML as my job. I do data science.

A lot of companies claiming that they invest in AI are significantly overstating their actual capabilities in the field. Many companies use their data scientists as a vanity team, and many more have a DS team that is unequipped because the company didn’t build their DE/DA infrastructure first - the just wanted to tout that they invest in AI. It’s a source of colossal frustration among DS that they’ll be hired on by companies that don’t have well-developed data management teams first, tying them up with DE tasks and bleeding an insane amount of money paying expensive R&D personnel to fulfill IT infrastructure tasks. All because companies don’t actually understand how to set up a data department, they just like the idea of having one.

And a quick edit here: that’s not to say that this is true of all DS departments. There are some companies doing truly incredible things with it. But the misuse of DS talent (and the overestimation of the abilities of AI) is prevalent. 

Furthermore, adoption will be slow. For one, it’s very hard to convince coats to trust a black box model over their own business acumen. Furthermore, industries that deal with privileged information will face significant legal challenges to any attempt they make at automating a process with AI.

* Healthcare - improvements in diagnoses and reduction in errors will bring dramatic improvements to margins.

* Surveillance - AI will offer new opportunities to surveil not just behaviors, but *intent.*
* Energy - there is still *every* possibility that all attempts to move off fossil fuels fail.

Yea I may be wrong but AI cannot do those tasks. I mean even simple book keeping AI cannot do. I mean tools are making it easier but ask an AI to go to a website and download a PDF or CSV file of your bank statement then reconcile it to your internal check book .

Yea those tools somewhat exist but it has to be very structured data, if there is one comma out of place the entire process fails. 

Even for basic book keeping or data entry , try scanning a PDF of some bill and trying to get the accounting system to book it and book it to the right accounts. We are still years and years off.

Computers just cannot handle unstructured data like a PDF, or paper statement/bill. even with OCR if it is able to read it good luck trying it to make sense out of it. And sure machine learning has gone pretty far so yes you could in theory scan 1000s and then code them into the accounting system and through machine learning it might get pretty good at processing but its still going to make mistakes and still going to need a human to check.

Also at best AI will replace the mundane grunt work most accountants hate, it will simply free them up to do higher level work, budgeting, forecasting , estimating ; reading up on all the new tax laws, tax breaks , tax loopholes ect...",SirGlass,3,/r/investing/comments/1232slb/investing_to_prepare_for_generative_ai/jdtvcc5/,0.051,0.803,0.147,0.9867

64,AI," There is potential for disruption though. Right now most top tech companies are there because of ad revenue, and their product drives consistent use month over month stably. But say for example everyone who has been googling problems for twenty years finds out they can ask GPT5 or something their question and get it exactly, faster, and more completely without having to scroll through links and click the one that’s most relevant? That could catch on like wildfire, and in two or three months we might all be doing that, and if Microsoft owns that tech it could pull the table cloth right out from under Google in a heartbeat.

 Volatile times to be in tech stocks. I’m only holding Apple right now because I believe they have a pretty strong moat and diversified revenue from software, hardware, and services and even people switch to using bing they’ll still be doing it on their iPhone.

70,AI," Good question! So, I don’t want to dox myself, but let me point out some *green flags* to look for in companies with healthy data operations.

- Companies touting AI technology should be able to describe how the models are leveraged by management to make smart decisions. For instance: “we use cutting edge AI technology!” is buzzword BS. “We use language processing models to direct your complaint to the right customer specialist quickly” is good, valid, and a very hot use case right now. 

- No company will divulge their entire tech stack to the public, but good companies will have public-facing employees who are clearly in charge of managing it. Whichever team DS falls under, usually IT or R&D, should have an SVP or executive with prior experience managing a data team. And going back to my first point - if they’re completely willing to share their entire tech stack, their team is poorly managed. No manager with a lick of sense will give out stack/model specifics externally. (Exception for companies whose AI products are open-source by design)

- Competent companies won’t use buzzword terms. Look at the StableDiffusion site. Absolutely no mention of terms like “state of the art” or “cutting edge” in their introduction, just a direct technical description: “SD is a latent text-to-image diffusion model (description) capable of generating photo-realistic images (use case).”

Hopefully this is helpful - this should help identify companies using it for actual things vs. using it for vanity.
