39,IMO," >	You don't know that you're wrong though

Yeah, just like you don’t know if you are right. The one sure thing you know, is that you don’t know for sure.
So you should always think of downside potential, not only upside.

>	Is tesla, amazon, microsoft, apple, ibm not gonna go up in 5/10/20 years? Hell, one of them might go under, but probably not all of them.

“5/10/20 years” is not a timeframe. Pick one. You got a life to live, and there is a huge difference between 5 and 20 years if you have plans for the money invested.
If I make a bad investment, telling myself it will probably be ok when I’m 10 years older is of no consolation.

But again, the great problem is that we don’t know the future and don’t even fully understand the present.
An example, focused on the shorter end of your timeframe:
There is a theory that the rise of some of the most capitalized stocks was in part fueled by the increasing trend of passive investing. As lots of money got funneled in index funds, they had to buy more of the biggest companies, which led them to become ever bigger in a self reinforcing cicle.
What happens if index funds lose favor, for example to the advantage of thematic stock pickers like ARK?

When we look at 10~20 years, the risks are even greater IMO.
Remember, Exxon was the biggest company in the world. Nokia and BlackBerry were industry leaders. Yahoo was the face of internet search, and MySpace the social network. Sega used to be a big player in home consoles. Sony Walkman had similar brand recognition as the iPod later and iPhone.

That’s why I feel that active stock picking with a very long time horizon is more dangerous, not less. We have no idea what will happen in 5 years, much less in 20!
There is zero guarantee that anyone who is great today will still be relevant after so long. Long time brand names and market leaders fade, new ones are born.

Think about it, in 20 years many of these products will be bought by people who aren’t even born yet! How can you know what they will like and choose?
Look at Facebook. The new generation doesn’t like it as much as the previous, favoring the likes of Instagram. Stuff that you find amazing, it may be old people’s crap in yet unborn eyes.

Friday and last week were wild and choppy but the last hour or so was incredible. The SPY rose like a godamn phoenix from it's ashes and printed a fantastic candle to close at the highs of the week. It's like once all the fucking selling dried up from hedge fund liquidation a great weight was removed from the markets. Shorts were routed once again. We're spitting distance away from ATH on SPY.

My bias is always to the upside. I think there will be more of the same. Rotation into real companies and more under performance in hype runners.

94,SPCE," Buffet is ALWAYS in cash. He has more cash than ever now...it is for a reason. Again, you are a poor excuse for a person if you cant deduce that my entire response was about how I feel and I am sure and I believe....I firmly believe that the entire market and world for that matter are currently drunk. The markets, real estate, the virus, trade, politics, there is no more up or down. It is all a mess. I feel the world starting to sober up a bit. I don't think we see a recovery the way most envision it. I see a recovery very quickly ended by lack of jobs and major problems with foreclosures and evictions also a huge lack of resources will keep the recovery to a minimum.  I feel that cash is better than equities for the very short term future....because the 7 trillion printed by the US is gonna really hurt. 

AS for BB. for sure it is a risk. It is  very calculated one on my part. BB will likely become the #1 name in EV and security software for the foreseeable future. I bought a ton at 4$ and 8$ and then sold it for 25$ I made life changing money. after I made more life changing money off GME. Im Im currently way down on my SPCE after Chamath sold his shares but not before I made a quick 20K off the ATH. I rebought BB at 13$ and a week or two after earnings I fully expect BB to be back up around 20$.

148,PACB," I work with sequencing data in general. Algorithm development and the sort. PACB long sequencing read technology is extremely useful for analyzing complex genomic events. By this I mean that I use it to detect special kinds of mutations where larger segments of the genome are modified. This is quite common in many types of cancer, and orphan diseases. For many years these kinds of mutations could only be detected using ""sanger sequencing"" this is a very old and very expensive technology. PACB has made huge strides in lowering the cost of this kind of genomic sequencing. 
I also use it for genome assembly, this is when the genetic material of an organism is sequenced and it's genome is reconstructed from the sequencing data.  Many organisms have the annoying property of having ""repetitive"" sequenced in their genome. PACB technology helps dealing with this kinds of issues.
This is why I am very bullish in companies line PACB and 10x genomics their technology has been maturing for several years and it is slowly starting to show clinical relevance at scale.

155,TSLA," ARKK is a fucking  elevator deathtrap that was in free fall but has currently stalled at the 100th floor. Remaining terrified passengers are trying to climb out to safety as the lift cable is broken and the brakes are about to fail for good.

I rather enjoyed reading clown face get ripped to pieces on twitter yesterday with the $3000 price target for TSLA by 2025.

I think puts on any bear market / OB rally is easy money now and for the foreseeable future. What's clear to me is that these stocks are 90% hyped up, air-gapped, over-valued garbage and the flagship company in the fund can't decide if they make EV's, make new batteries, trade BTC, have a lock on autonomous driving or want to colonize another fucking planet.",Gravity-Rides,13,/r/stocks/comments/mf4qmg/arkk_has_put_in_a_bottom/gslnyb3/,0.106,0.735,0.159,0.7359

However to add, my opinion has changed on what the Nasdaq does next month. Still wouldn't be surprised if it jumped 8-10% but I'm now less than convinced it'll make it back to ATH (although an 8-10% jump would take it back to ATH), and with the absolute beating the ARK stocks have taken, the best case is it gets to the $130's in April probably.

Cash being low is a concern since ARKK is experiencing outflows and the more that happens the more she will need to start selling positions to cover them.  Meme stocks in particular are falling from grace and it's also possible with the economy reopening that people are losing interests in playing the stock market.

159,TSLA," So... they shouldn’t present their case for predicted future value based on their understanding of future market conditions? I really don’t see how their forecast for Tesla is a conflict of interest. Transparency and forecasting are part of Ark’s thing.

Basically their entire prospectus is oriented around this idea that these technologies will hit an inflection point as they approach mass adoption and their stock values will grow rapidly. When they show their work on this for Tesla, everyone freaks out and says “Hey wait a minute, that’s too much! You can’t do that! They’re just pumping!” Those arguments just don’t hold much water with me. What would be the point in pumping something with a five year forecast? The timeline is too long for the pump to matter, even if the price rises short term it will drop to what people are comfortable with inside of that timeframe. Would damage the funds reputation for no real gain. I think it’s just cynicism run amok. Their TSLA evaluation is just an example of the kind of growth that Ark has always claimed is at the center of their investment strategy. But everyone gets all offended when they predict exactly what they always said they were trying to target. Maybe they’ll be right on Tesla, or maybe they’ll be right on one of their other holdings, that’s why you buy the fund instead of just TSLA. If a few take off the fund as a whole benefits. If Ark is wrong, the risk is distributed amongst their other holdings. 

If you compare five year growth for any major companies that have been successful with new technology, Ark’s evaluation for Tesla looks aggressive but not really obscene. This of course assumes Ark is right about TSLA being much more than just as auto manufacturer.

185,NOW," So, let me first say that I am bullish steel and other industrial metals.  
However, the post is asking for a bearish case for steel as it relates to the semiconductor shortage.  To that end, I'll play devil's advocate. the bearish case is that semiconductor supply to domestic automotive supply-chains are tightest.  In fact some U.S. auto assembly plants are being taken off line NOW as a result of the semiconductor chip shortage.  The auto industry is a large consumer of steel.  The chip shortage will artificially stunt U.S. auto production and an important component of domestic steel demand. This reduction in demand will result in a reduction in steel prices.

As for the geopolitical situation (tensions) with China impacting Chinese steel imports, the Section 232 tariffs enacted under Trump and widely supported and reaffirmed by the Biden administration place a 25% tariff on Chinese (among other) steel (& 10% tariffs on aluminum) imports.  This has definitely already curtailed imports, driven prices up and spurred an expansion in U.S. steel making capacity.  

BTW, Taiwan has historically and  consistently considered itself independent from Taiwan.  US has a long history of selling Taiwan arms to protect itself against China and would likely intervene to support Taiwan in the case of an actionable threat.

Let the quarterly earnings come through and the tech sector will prove it's worth....these are good blue chip stocks.

As for the other sectors like growth and speculative plays such as in the ark k fund they will have to improve their quarterly  earnings and EPS to show they can be profitable it will take a more than one year.....I recommend you watch some of the recent videos  of cathie wood where she talks abt growth stocks...and wht to expect....from her funds.

So I say for the above hold and hold dont sell....concentrate on 2 things
Average down if you have spare cash.......and increase your cash holdings too SAVE sit on cash.....remember  cash is an asset too.

As for Chilean funds...if u cant see an improved outlook...you might just have to take a loss...thts part of investing and learning the best Investers lose money it's part of the game....so cut your losses be honest about the future potential  of those investments.

201,USA," Yeah i don't really want to invest in specific stocks because of this. Losing 70% of my portfolio wouldn't even surprise me after all that's happened. I can see your point there, being -17% in the red is not really that bad, but it's been 5 years of not being able to use that money, 5 years of disciplined saving in an indexed fund which is supposed to be safer and it's been nothing but losing money in my personal experience.

So i think i'm doing something wrong. I'm bullish on Chile: fast vaccination, the index is not in a bubble, actually over 1.5 standard deviations lower than other countries according to analysts. So it should keep recovering right? But these terrible events keep happening, one after another. So i dont really know what i should do.

So i take this fintech fund that invests in USA tech mainly and the next day i'm in the red already. And the next month is worse and now it keeps getting worse and worse. It honestly looks as if I single-handedly caused the tech-sector crash because of me investing in it. 

So yeah, i'll just keep waiting for years and years while my portfolio keeps crashing and crashing. Maybe in 20 years i'll be at 0% again? But i keep seeing these success stories of profits in the market... but for me even a 1% profit in 5 years would look AMAZING compared to where i'm at right now.",tetraethylammoniumX,1,/r/stocks/comments/mf6a9g/i_save_my_entire_income_and_cant_stop_losing_money/gsm1vkh/,0.112,0.758,0.13,0.7921

PYPL - Payments can be tricky, their acquisitions have helped.  In addition, the remittance area is pretty strong.  I wouldn't buy, but have plenty from 2015 myself, slowly liquidating (down to about $200,000 currently).  Haven't seen their tech stack in a few years but based upon the pace of change, not seeing them make major strides. 

TGT - Not seeing major tail winds to provide support.  Went with a WMT play last year that didn't pay off.

FB - Hiring but their antics during the 2020 election has me not returning the calls of their recruiter.  Good technological stack though.  In other words, they're not going to pay me enough...

DIS - Got hit hard with COVID, especially with the park being shut down in CA, and then there is the cruise line fiasco that is coming down as well.

HD / LOW - Good plays, typically after a disaster when people are buying up wood and hurricane supplies to rebuild.  Come summer, expect to see generators still being sold as CA shuts down their power grid again.

NFLX - Tough to call.  Had contacts with people who went to work there and they said it's brutal internally.  That of course drives innovation and change as people want to keep their jobs.  However, AMZN and HBO are moving in that direction as well.

NVDA and AMD are chip makers.  I'm also looking out for $500 NVDA but leery about the chip / supply shortage (Suez included) forcing NVDA to release video cards which are hobbled.  Huge backlog for RTX 3080 / 3090 since the release of November.

I do not see anything stopping an AMZN juggernaut in the future.  They're not embroiled in the Section 230 censorship issue, and have broadened into many areas the same way that MSFT has as well.  Not even calls for the break up of them as part of a monopoly discussion as we had with MSFT in the past.

343,LPG," Yeah this is very interesting, but seems also an awfully long shot.

A few things to think over:

Price remains a concern.

Distribution also. It needs to be adopted by the whole industry or it won’t make it to your fuel station.

Green fuels won’t stop the move to EVs. Electric is just better to drive, easier to care, doesn’t smell and choke you when you are in a trafficked road or big city.

Let’s not forget we already have a kind-of environmental friendly and inexpensive alternative fuel: LPG.
I have a dual fuel LPG car. With it I can go in the city center on days of traffic closure, and at a rough calculation it’s about as expensive to run as EV charged on a public fast chargers. No range anxiety, and the car itself is much cheaper than a EV.
You can also convert many existing cars to use it. Yet you don’t see anyone care much about.

In fact, it probably gets willfully ignored to make the case for EV look more compelling. EV savings on pollution and fuel are shown against petrol and diesel, rather than the better option, LPG.

So eFuels, assuming they see adoption, may become just an option to keep certain old cars usable for longer. Specifically, sport and historic cars, which are unfeasible to convert to LPG because of the need of an additional fuel tank goes against the spirit of preservation. That’s not a huge business.

For most everyone else, the eFuel option exists and is available already, it’s called LPG, and the masses already don’t care because it’s not new and shiny anymore.",year0000,5,/r/stocks/comments/meurie/volkswagens_other_play_synthetic_fuel_vow_vwagy/gsk9262/,0.066,0.798,0.136,0.9693
344,ICE," I work in public policy in Germany where the debate on electric mobility vs. hydrogen mobility vs. synthetic fuels has been settled for a while now. the long story short is, electric mobility, due to simple physics, has the highest overall energy efficiency, from your solar panels or wind turbines to your wheel. hydrogen is distant second, synthetic fuels are dead last. in fact, you need 4 to 5 times more solar and wind power for the same number of kilometres driven for hydrogen than for direct electric drive. that translates into 4 to 5 times the capex for power production alone, plus capex for the extra conversion step from power to hydrogen (ever heard that electrolysers being expensive? well ...). for synthetic fuels you need *even more* clean power and *another extra* conversion step. no amount of subsidies will make synthetic fuels competitive with battery in our life times. all serious researchers and policy consultants have known this since before the battery prices dropped 90% in the last decade. there’s a reason Tesla is the most valuable carmaker in the world.

You know to whom synthetic fuels make sense? To the carmakers still sticking theit head in the sand and hoping the governments bail them out. although it’s probably not even an honest play at this point anymore and even they know the future is electric, but their c-suite has to make it look like they’re on top of things and earn their golden parachutes. that’s why they need to make it appear like the internal combustion engine has a future in a zero-carbon world. in Germany, you can see how busy the still-world leading carmakers are lobbying for the slowest transition and the most toothless regulations possible. with some success, too. but if the battery prices drop another 50% by 2025 and the upfront cost of an BEV is on paar with an ICE, it won’t even matter anymore. 

sure, synthetic fuels might be how (parts of) air and sea traffic are decarbonised, and renewable hydrogen will be needed in industry. but for road transport, don’t buy the carmaker’s propaganda.

345,ICE," To their credit, in an interview I saw with someone at Porsche, the eFuel was presented as a way to try keeping existing cars on the road for longer, more than an alternative to EV.

I see it largely aimed at cars that have a heritage, preserving the past. Think of car collectors and lovers, at all the existing iconic vehicles from brands like Ferrari and of course Porsche, even some relatively inexpensive ones like the Alfa Romeo Duetto.

Probably they also want to tranquillize the buyers of luxury cars today, that if you spend 100-200k on a new ICE Porsche today it will have a long life ahead.

Anyway, cool cars are being made largely road illegal by the new emission standards, and this affects common people not only collectors.
I have a Mazda MX-5 NB, both a very inexpensive and very cool drive, but it’s emission standard Euro 3, which makes its circulation already illegal in some big cities.

BABA is certainly at risk for it's association w/ Jack Ma's crew as well as the general crackdown. There was a great WSJ piece in the past month about the complicated ownership structure of Ant Group where a lot of people in Jiang Zemin's faction secretly owned shares through various structures. And that it made Xi mad. It wasn't just the credit risk Ant Group posed that led to him pulling the plug on the IPO.

So, I don't think any of us really have transparency on the details of that imo. It's a risk.

And I bought in when it dropped to the 220's in December so I'm still long. But it's definitely a risk.

In all honesty if it fell to 300 it's only considered a ""deal"" due to where it traded previously. Bitcoin pricing also matters a lot to Tesla. Tesla needs a good catalyst or it'll fall below 500 as a norm in the short term. No idea what the future holds. I'm not as bullish on EV even if it's the future. Auto companies where never a popular investment but now we think they are because they will be producing electric vehicles. 

Autonomous vehicles are the only tech I see as a disruptive technology that will change things dramatically but a vehicle doesn't need to be electric powered to be autonomous.

I'm glad Tesla exists so we can talk about it everyday. It's a high risk high reward play. Lots of people made a lot of money. I like Elon Musk. I don't like TSLA valuation.",GMEgotmehere,31,/r/stocks/comments/meyi1i/is_it_end_of_tesla/gskhupy/,0.058,0.826,0.116,0.9307

437,FSD," I think the Tesla hype is slowly coming to an end. There are the following reasons for this:

Tesla is getting serious competition; the demand for EVs can now be met by other companies. Market share is shrinking in all markets and will shrink even more in the coming months.

FSD is a big lie. Elon has been promising it would be available next year since 2015. What is the problem now? Many people spent 10k on the potential for FSD. But now years have passed and people may have already bought a new car in the meantime. The 10k was totally wasted. And Tesla itself has admitted that FSD is only level 2 and this will not get better in the near future. 

Gruenheide is properly delayed. No cars will come off the assembly lines there in the summer. Completely impossible.

You can also see that Elon's ass is on the line. He tries to hide all this bad news with one smoke grenade after the other. The bitcoin purchase, his appointment as technoking, etc. The house of cards is slowly collapsing and people are realizing that they own a non-profitable car company that will only have single digit market share in a few years and can't build robotiaxis.",GordonGekkoVienna,26,/r/stocks/comments/meyi1i/is_it_end_of_tesla/gskkcty/,0.118,0.844,0.038,-0.9423

439,IMO," It's not the end of Tesla. but it is the end of the hype. 

(a) IMO fair value is somewhere near $350. This is sort of a mid-point for a variety of estimates from analysts who aren't in the Tesla cult, ranging from about $100 to $500. every stock eventually settles near fair value, which is why valuation matters in the first place. 

(b) any time a stock shoots straight up on the chart, like Tesla did, the stock WILL come back down. it's inevitable. spikes straight upwards are not driven by changes in the company's sales status and financial info but by irrational investor behavior that is always corrected. 

(c) Tesla is only narrowly profitable, and that's from selling regulatory credits to other car markers. Once other companies start selling more EVs, they won't need to buy the green credits from Tesla

441,AAPL," I bought a 500 shares of TSLA during the current dip.  I am not concerned about VW at all.

I have a Porsche Cayenne S, 911S and a BMW.  They all have a few things in common, the electrical sucks, the plastic sucks.  The metal is great (engine and body).  That's the opposite of what EV needs.  I have no doubt that VW EV owners will have to replace the battery around 5-7 years of ownership.

Typical car companies save the newest features for the best model.   TSLA is not doing this (the Model Y has newer/better features than the model X).  I agree with this approach.

I've not met an actual TSLA owner that is pissed off because of the delay in FSD.  Infact, I've know more people w/o FSD than with.  That's great for TSLA.  By the time FSD gains traction, there will be a ton of vehicles w/o FSD hitting the used market.  All TSLA needs to do is adding FSD to those vehicles and turn them around for a 5-10k extra profit.

The current US electrical grid is not suitable for large scale EV adoption.  To level out the demand, whole house battery/solar system is needed, TSLA definitely has a horse in this race.

China is a very important market and TSLA is the AAPL of the Chinese EV market.  Sure there are tons of local brands phone with more features at a lesser price,  the iPhone still has great profit from the Chinese market.  Tesla will be the same - a #1 choice among the richer part of the population.  EU EVs will also share this richer population but w/o the benefit of a local factory.

Other smaller EV companies are just noise.  Things only get serious when AAPL and Toyota enter the market.

TSLA is also a b-i-t-c-o-i-n holding company.  While many people may thing it's a negative,  I think it's a good thing for the company.  it's not much different from McDonald is as much as real estate company as a fast food company.  It sets the low for the company values.


Most people would agree that last month TSLA has seen very significant drop.  Look at the data,  it's more than $10/week.  However I also lower my cost basis by $8-$10/week selling CC while waiting for the chip shortage to lift and the cyber truck to roll out.  Now if TSLA drops down to the $500 then I won't be able to sell CC at my original purchase price and may have to hold.  I'll worry about that when the time comes.

If you can't effort to get 100 shares of TSLA, it's not a stock for you.  The ability to get high premium consistently is the key during the chip shortage period - ""get paid while you wait"" should the slogan for owning TSLA stock.

When TSLA hit 380 during the battery day week,  some people wanted to wait for 350 to get in.  They've been waiting ever since.  To be fair,  I bought a bunch of shares at 380 just to have them called away quickly after at 450.

444,TSLA," I bought a 500 shares of TSLA during the current dip.  I am not concerned about VW at all.

I have a Porsche Cayenne S, 911S and a BMW.  They all have a few things in common, the electrical sucks, the plastic sucks.  The metal is great (engine and body).  That's the opposite of what EV needs.  I have no doubt that VW EV owners will have to replace the battery around 5-7 years of ownership.

Typical car companies save the newest features for the best model.   TSLA is not doing this (the Model Y has newer/better features than the model X).  I agree with this approach.

I've not met an actual TSLA owner that is pissed off because of the delay in FSD.  Infact, I've know more people w/o FSD than with.  That's great for TSLA.  By the time FSD gains traction, there will be a ton of vehicles w/o FSD hitting the used market.  All TSLA needs to do is adding FSD to those vehicles and turn them around for a 5-10k extra profit.

The current US electrical grid is not suitable for large scale EV adoption.  To level out the demand, whole house battery/solar system is needed, TSLA definitely has a horse in this race.

China is a very important market and TSLA is the AAPL of the Chinese EV market.  Sure there are tons of local brands phone with more features at a lesser price,  the iPhone still has great profit from the Chinese market.  Tesla will be the same - a #1 choice among the richer part of the population.  EU EVs will also share this richer population but w/o the benefit of a local factory.

Other smaller EV companies are just noise.  Things only get serious when AAPL and Toyota enter the market.

TSLA is also a b-i-t-c-o-i-n holding company.  While many people may thing it's a negative,  I think it's a good thing for the company.  it's not much different from McDonald is as much as real estate company as a fast food company.  It sets the low for the company values.


Most people would agree that last month TSLA has seen very significant drop.  Look at the data,  it's more than $10/week.  However I also lower my cost basis by $8-$10/week selling CC while waiting for the chip shortage to lift and the cyber truck to roll out.  Now if TSLA drops down to the $500 then I won't be able to sell CC at my original purchase price and may have to hold.  I'll worry about that when the time comes.

If you can't effort to get 100 shares of TSLA, it's not a stock for you.  The ability to get high premium consistently is the key during the chip shortage period - ""get paid while you wait"" should the slogan for owning TSLA stock.

446,EQS," I don't hold Tesla. I put abit of money into Daimler instead when I started investing not long ago.  


I'm looking forward to where it will go, so far a bit gains for me, and I'm interesting to see how market will respond when they revail the EQS on april 15. th. They say come with battery that has range of over 700 km (437 miles). [News of the EQS](https://www.daimler.com/innovation/digitalisation/industry-4-0/battery-production-hedelfingen.html)  


Also looks like they have entered joint venture with Volvo about fuel cell production.  


So while Tesla might have robotaxi comming, it will be interesting to see if Daimler trucks will come with self-driving trucks. I would imagine there would be more money in that than taxi driving. [Daimler selfdriving truck](https://www.daimler.com/innovation/case/autonomous/automated-driving-daimler-trucks.html) But other companies is also researching this e.g. scania have gotten green light by swedish government to test self driving trucks on the free ways.  


So while many hails Tesla for self driving and that they soon will have robotaxi, I think other companies a not far behind in making selfdriving vihicles.

448,AI," In addition, I wonder if Tesla fanboys today care of Tesla’s future more than Elon himself.

For the inexperienced investors holding Tesla stock, it can be seen as a precious, unique ticket to riches and validation.
In a market full of uncertainties and risks, there is their certainty of success. They see it as irreplaceable because they can’t see any alternative.

For Musk, Tesla is largely Mission Accomplished. It kickstarted - or at least accelerated - the switch to EV. It helped bring a change on the world.

What’s left equally amazing for Tesla to do? Sell lots of cars? So unglamorous, not a goal worthy of a visionary.
Revolutionize self driving? Many extremely skilled companies are already working on it. It’s not an unique opportunity to make a difference. Green energy? Same story.

If Elon wants to aim again for the moon, he probably needs to move his attention progressively away from Tesla. And that’s what I expect him to do.
Rockets, AI, cyber interfaces, are some of the objects that have long been on his mind.

A funny idea, what happens if Musk founds a new company to work full time on some new, ambitious world changing goal? Where does that leave Tesla shareholders betting on future something-or-the-other, Tesla-is-an-everything-company? Hanging on to the dreams of yesterday?

There are companies that are good buys that have become meme stocks, and adversely there are super crap companies that have become meme stocks.

I saw someone mention AMD as a meme stock just a moment ago. AMD is a long term hold that is already profitable, not exactly a meme stock imo. 

Gamestop is definitely a meme stock. They are at least ten years late to the game and they have paid the price for it. I'd love to see them turn it around, but they are now competing directly with the console manufacturers as well as first movers such as Newegg. 

I wouldn't call BB a meme stock, but definitely a little bit of a gamble on if they can pull off the software turnaround long term. (I have a small allocation to BB).

Sadly Tesla is a meme stock. Great company that will hopefully be around long term, but horrendously overvalued for current metrics. Don't get me started on ARKs thesis on Tesla, it shows a fundamental lack of understanding of how many aspects of the company work (or can work), as well as showing that Cathie has maybe lost touch with reality just a tad.

Speculation is dangerous. When you see people saying ""I'm new, BUT... ___ is a no brainer""... kind of a sign that it will end up badly. Understand that a lot of the people pumping meme stocks have not-a-clue what they are doing.

Anyone is welcome to paperhand at any point... but I’ll keep seeing where this does finally end up. I’m young, it’s really not that much money in the long run.

505,GME," The bond market showed signs that interest rates needed to go up to counter inflation. The fed has been pumping trillions in liquidity into the system, and has indicated they won't stop unless we reach full employment or inflation gets too high.

Since there were signs of inflation, there was fear the fed would reign things in, and that fear was being priced in.

Could GME be another reason? Maybe. It's possible. However, even at $10,000 per share (likely an insane price even as a brief peak during a short squeeze), it would take $350B to close all short positions. And there's no way all the short positions close at a price that high.

I couldn't find any ETF which has a meaningful impact on GME? The biggest ETF is iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF where GME is 0.29% of the total.

There are some other where GME has 3-4% of the total, but the total fund size of these is just way too low to even have any impact.
