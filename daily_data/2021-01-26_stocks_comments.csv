Nokia (along with Samsung and Ericsson) seem to be getting a boost for 5G contracts in the west over concerns around Huawei.

416,GM,"A 2018 article about manufacturer backed dealerships focused on Tesla.  16 states prohibit anything but privately franchised dealerships.  This means that 2018's info shows that Tesla is not allowed to sell cars in 16 states, with very limited allowances in others (Colorado can only have 1 dealership, Ohio Tesla can only have 3 places).  If you go on Tesla's web site you can see huge swaths of the country devoid of places to buy the cars.  Meanwhile all other established car makers like GM and even BMW can sell their EV's in all states with no restrictions.  Tesla could migrate to privately franchised dealerships, but that has not been their policy.  The reason these laws got started was to protect dealerships (some of the largest job creators) from having the manufacturer open a place across the street.

Chinese companies received subsidies with no particular fight from Obama and Biden.  So Chinese EVs will receive subsidies to disadvantage Tesla.

in Europe the protectionism is more under the table, but again it is there to disadvantage an American brand.

I invested in PINS when a lot of brands and advertisers pulled out of Facebook back in late July. Being in the industry, I knew that media budgets would have to be shifted somewhere, and we had heard so much about Pinterest and their move to ecomm. Plus, they offer really cool ad placements that seem to flow nicely within a feed and doesn't seem overly intrusive. Plus, the fact that the pandemic would be stretching longer and people would be doing crafts going into fall. 

The bet paid off. I bought in at $20 and it shot up to like $50 seemingly overnight. I sold some, and did some DCA for a while. 

From an advertising perspective, it's the new kid on the block. I've sat in on a few presentations pre-pandemic and I like what they offer. My clients like what they offer and like the platform. A lot of brands are trying them out. They're not the first choice, like FB and IG, but brands are open to advertising on there.

694,PINS,"Literally just came here to ask the same thing. It can't seem to get over the $73-$74 hurdle. 

I invested in PINS when a lot of brands and advertisers pulled out of Facebook back in late July. Being in the industry, I knew that media budgets would have to be shifted somewhere, and we had heard so much about Pinterest and their move to ecomm. Plus, they offer really cool ad placements that seem to flow nicely within a feed and doesn't seem overly intrusive. Plus, the fact that the pandemic would be stretching longer and people would be doing crafts going into fall. 

The bet paid off. I bought in at $20 and it shot up to like $50 seemingly overnight. I sold some, and did some DCA for a while.

For example, if you buy a call when a stock is at 40 predicting it will go to 60, you can generally flip it for a partial profit if it starts rising above 40 (before the expiry).",0.073,0.872,0.056,-0.2023

Click that line. It will show you the Options Chain for PLTR. Note the drop down with the date. These are the Expiration Dates. 

Below the date are the different Strike Prices and the Last Price. Other things of importance is Bid (what they will pay you), Ask (what you pay them) and Volume (number of contracts traded). 

The first listed are Calls and ITM (In The Money) and when it changes color that is ATM (At the Money). Anything after the first change in color is OTM(Out of the Money). 

Scroll down and you will see Puts. First come OTM then ATM then ITM. 

When people trade opens (buy or sell), they actually Trade options. You have to because they expire eventually. 

The stock trades at $10. You think it will go up so you Buy a $12 Strike for $1 30 days to expiration (DTE). 

In a week the stock rockets to $15. So your call option is now worth $2.5. So you can Sell to Close (STC) your call and you are Done and you keep $2.5 - $1 or $1.50. 

All these numbers are x100. So you paid $100 and your profit is $150. 

If after a week the stock doesn’t move or goes down, your $1 option might be worth $0.45. Do you buy it back and lose $0.55 or let it ride?

As expiration approaches the stock at $12. Did you win? No. That is because you paid $1 for a $12 strike which adds to $13 so you make money above $13. 

Simple enough?

Also Options are a Sum Zero game. For every winner there is a loser. Unlike stocks. That should put some fear in you. 

Buy a cheap book are read it 3 times. Then watch YouTube videos. You will find people that speak at your level. And then move up. 

I added a Paper Trading account at TDA and download Think or Swim. It’s complicated. Overwhelming. Back to YouTube. 

Once you are Consistently made money then start slowly with real money. 

There is a subreddit r/options and r/thetagang that discuss options and there are some Really smart people there so just read it all. 

Just an example of a trade I’m in. 

PLTR was trading in the low 30’s. I’m bullish. So I SOLD a February 19th PUT (last week) for $3 (x100). 

So my breakeven (BE) is 30 - 3 or $27. So I was good with that risk. PLTR is rose to $36 and is above my Put and I’m up $75 right now. I’ll probably make $2 - $2.50 on that trade. Not bad for 3 weeks. 

And with Sold options you can roll them out in time and change the strike price and you can collect more premium than the $3 I already collected. 

I owned 100 shares in CVS and SOLD Covered calls for a year. My shares were finally called away recently. I made $1000 in option premium, $500 on the stock and $200 in dividends. Not bad for a year. 

Study until you understand every thing I said (except typos).

And finally learn this with an OTB (Options Trading buddy). You need to learn the “lingo” or you can’t express your thoughts.

A caveat - if I don't understand fully why the price is going up, I will usually just sit on it, and / or sell. For example, I sold SBE at $44.5 and took my profit.
