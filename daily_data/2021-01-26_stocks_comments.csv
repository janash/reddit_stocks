As likely as GME was to experience a short squeeze at some point within the past couple months and it was being talked about in WSB, there’s a reason people didn’t say specifically, “watch it hit $40 soon.” “It’ll hit $70+ and $150+ within weeks.” It’s all memes and to the moons and hop aboard the rockets.

Sometimes it means 3-5x the value then people talk about cashing out. Sometimes it’s 10x value then a violent crash and half the sub parades the fact that they were out on the way down. The other half...... diamond 🙌 and holding until 20205!!!!!!!

Take a moment to recognize history in the making. Recognize not even Tesla went 50x it’s value in a matter of a few months like GME just did.

When the price of GME is far from $80, they don't need to buy as many shares as the number in the options they sold. However, as GME gets closer to $80, they need to buy up to the full amount in shares that they sold options for in order to cover their position.

Nokia (along with Samsung and Ericsson) seem to be getting a boost for 5G contracts in the west over concerns around Huawei.

Why a pump? It (was) under $5, and is one of Robinhood's most popular stocks, 'nuff said.

Why Real? Massive board change with new CEO a year after they suspended their dividend. A report from a major Scandinavian financial institution comes out suggesting NOK may reinstate their dividend next ER (2/4). This would be better than a surprising earnings beat. I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow, but I think the major catalyst will be whether the dividend is reinstated.

Apple is going to market a car in 2024.

QNX makes car software work in EV.

Apple is rumored to be expanding its office in Canada, their current office is right next door to Blackberry/QNX.  Like 50 yards away.  Seriously.

Apple has already siphoned of some of the QNX staff, but not all, and not the source code.

Apple needs QNX software for their EV.

Blackberry has 38,000 patents, with 10,000 of those with the word ‘vehicle’ in the patent.

Apple can use these patents. Apple needs these patents to get into a new car market. They are going to get their ass sued off when they start selling cars.

Tesla could also use these patents. Uber, Ford, GM, BMW, Hyundai, Kia, Toyota, could use these patents. And the QNX software and software team.

Apple is (my guess only) making a bid for Blackberry to scoop up the rest of the QNX team, the source code and the patents. Tesla may be making a counterbid. Other players might be involved. Elon uses the QNX code already in his spacecars.

Position:194 shares at $19.28


Disclaimer: I started trading this January and my views are purely informational and I do not condone anyone making financial/trading decisions based on this post. Do your DD before you trade. This is a bullish take on BB and may have some holes in it.



So I have been watching BB for a while now and feel the company is undervalued. Forgive me as I have not made a DD post before, I failed English in high school, and I am typing this up on my phone.


BB originally caught my attention because it struck me that it survived being primarily a phone company and shifted its business to its cyber security and other software. I Put it on my watch list to swing it a little bit and recently sold 140 shares at $11.


Seeing the price go up and the volume I decided I would jump back in since the trend analysis looked pretty good. Bought in at 19.28 and it almost immediately crashed, I suspect likely due to the pullback the whole market had this morning with stimulus talks being delayed.


Canada Halts trading today due to the volatility followed by BB making a statement in response basically saying idk why investors are buying up the stock we haven’t made any announcements 
Trading resumes and the price rises back up beyond open in AH, closing at nearly 20 dollars.

THEN as you have already probably seen, BB announces partnership with Baidu - coincidence? Probably not, investors probably coaxed that information out of them and they likely didn’t want to get caught in some insider trading schenangians. 

Speculation for tomorrow: BB Will open strong and meet or exceed the 40% growth of today since it just got that huge news. Baidu is Chinese google, and they partnered with BB since they need a operating system platform to mass produce their maps software in autonomous/ev vehicles with their partner GAC. Now this is a lot of China talk but BB is headquartered in CANADA which is much friendlier in regards to trade than the U.S.


A little bit of information about GAC, they are a Chinese automotive giant that has came to the United States National Automobile Dealers association expos begging for investors, however has not had much success since the last 4 years have not been good for U.S. and China Trade.


The LONG game: Once our new administration warms up to China after those in charge of trade take their cuts, (and they will because history repeats itself, but right now the bear case would be that Biden is not looking to change tariffs on China, playing tough until he gets some leverage is what I think is really going on) GAC will have lots of opportunity to start putting their vehicles on our roads. 
GAC is the highest rated car brand in China so it may have a chance in the United States if it plays its cards right, which means we could have Blackberry powered Autonomous EVs on our streets in the next 5 years. 

This company has a lot of value in our up and coming future of Electric and Autonomous vehicles.

Should you get in on GME now with all of this insane volatility?  Personally, if I wasn't already in, no, I wouldn't get in now.  But I do genuinely believe there's some high long-term value here.

I'm sorry, but I'm visiting from WSB.  No rockets or profanity here, though, other than me openly admitting that I am a full-on moronic degenerate (I refuse to use some of their more colorful language, even when posting there where it's tolerated).

I've written two pieces of due diligence about GameStop that I believe is valuable not just to short-term investors but also to long-term investors, and there are likely more long-term investors here than are in WSB.  Every now and then some quality DD pops up over there, but it gets buried by memes and shills.  I apologize if this is in poor taste or if this content is better posted in another sub.  This is the only place I could think of with a sizeable membership that might actually give a damn.

If you'd indulge my dumb ass, I invite you to read my research and if you have any comments or constructive criticism on how to write better due diligence, I would be happy to know.

This looks at Ryan Cohen, recent addition to the GME board of directors.  It also looks at where GME currently stands with its (old and busted) business model.  Of interest to investors are some comments on near-term X factors to consider before investing.  Finally, there's napkin math gain/loss potential, as well as a brief list of three potential new business strategies they could execute, none of which are mutually exclusive.

\[Potential strategy analysis - GME/MS partnership\]([https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l47u0y/potential\_gme\_strategy\_component\_online/](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l47u0y/potential_gme_strategy_component_online/))

One potential strategy for GME is analyzed more in depth here - the partnership between GameStop and Microsoft announced in October 2020.  Based on the hypothesis that that relationship might deepen, it explores variations of strategy as that relationship deepens and ultimately arrives to a few endgame strategies for GME to consider.

There is a third piece I have to write that fleshes out what I believe could be GameStop's new set of strategies, and given everything I've read about Mr. Cohen, his history, his bros that he brought with him to the board, and GameStop's current financial position in terms of fcf, assets and global reach, I believe that these strategies make sense and will begin execution probably this year.  Cohen doesn't like twiddling his thumbs.

Again, I'm sorry WSB is leaking.  I'm only sharing because I think it might help.  If this stuff is garbage, hopefully a mod here will spare you and delete this.

\[Potential strategy analysis - GME/MS partnership\]([https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l47u0y/potential\_gme\_strategy\_component\_online/](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l47u0y/potential_gme_strategy_component_online/))

One potential strategy for GME is analyzed more in depth here - the partnership between GameStop and Microsoft announced in October 2020.  Based on the hypothesis that that relationship might deepen, it explores variations of strategy as that relationship deepens and ultimately arrives to a few endgame strategies for GME to consider.

There is a third piece I have to write that fleshes out what I believe could be GameStop's new set of strategies, and given everything I've read about Mr. Cohen, his history, his bros that he brought with him to the board, and GameStop's current financial position in terms of fcf, assets and global reach, I believe that these strategies make sense and will begin execution probably this year.  Cohen doesn't like twiddling his thumbs.

Again, I'm sorry WSB is leaking.  I'm only sharing because I think it might help.  If this stuff is garbage, hopefully a mod here will spare you and delete this.

Feedback is welcome.  Thanks for reading this far (or even just this line).

429,MS,"Disclaimer:  I'm not a financial advisor, this isn't financial advice.  Whatever you do with your money and/or positions is up to you.  I also have long positions in GME.  You absolutely do not have to buy, and if you're holding, I don't care if you sell.  I would rather you do what you believe is best for you.

Should you get in on GME now with all of this insane volatility?  Personally, if I wasn't already in, no, I wouldn't get in now.  But I do genuinely believe there's some high long-term value here.

I'm sorry, but I'm visiting from WSB.  No rockets or profanity here, though, other than me openly admitting that I am a full-on moronic degenerate (I refuse to use some of their more colorful language, even when posting there where it's tolerated).

I've written two pieces of due diligence about GameStop that I believe is valuable not just to short-term investors but also to long-term investors, and there are likely more long-term investors here than are in WSB.  Every now and then some quality DD pops up over there, but it gets buried by memes and shills.  I apologize if this is in poor taste or if this content is better posted in another sub.  This is the only place I could think of with a sizeable membership that might actually give a damn.

If you'd indulge my dumb ass, I invite you to read my research and if you have any comments or constructive criticism on how to write better due diligence, I would be happy to know.

1. The short being squeezed got bailed out today for 2.7 billion. Won’t have to cover anymore. 

2. Future Gamma squeeze has been cancelled as well because option premiums are way too expensive for it to be possible. 

3. The pump and dump participants are mostly already in. So less and less money is going to buy at higher and higher prices. 

4. ETFS holding GME are now imbalanced (overweight GME) and will need to sell to rebalance. 

5. Institutional holders of GME will also look to rebalance. 

6. GME stock offering is plausible at anytime. 

7. Downside risk is a massive -85% despite all the $1,000 calls it’s extremely unlikely GME will even kiss $160 again. R/R is very bad particularly if you are holding overnight. We could see a massive top run that takes out all the stops to $40 or even to $20 should some selling pickup.

503,GME,"Large traders were ""shorting"" GME stocks, which is essentially selling a share that you do not currently own on the basis that you will buy it later on when it (hopefully) reduces in price. So they ""shorted"" the stocks at $4 as they expected the stocks to drop in price, when they would later buy the stocks back at let's say $2. Their profit would then be $2 per share.


However, the price has been increasing for various reasons and the shorters pay interest on the stock price until they buy the shares back that they shorted. In addition, there are a very large amount of shorted shares (more than are actually in total circulation). So it's turning into a game of chicken whereby the hedge funds are trying to hold off buying the shares back and everyone else wants to hold on to the shares and drive them higher. If the hedge funds cave and start to buy shares back this will (WSB hopes) cause a cascading upwards price of the stocks as there are so many that need to be bought back to cover their positions.

* GME has nostalgic connection for people like blockbuster did

* short sellers see an opportunity to make money by claiming GME is shit, like they always do. one noteable clown from Citron did the same with NIO. 

* WSB saw through this shit and got annoyed at short seller manipulating the market with their lies for personal gain. Everyone dumped money into GME to fight short sellers

* short sellers lost millions

* GME opened today and went to the moon, briefly. Everyone who is a normie panicked and sold their share for tiny profit.

* real men are holding that GME can go back up.

I don't think this section of your DD is entirely correct.

While yes, there are applications out there that will handle processing power of games server side, that link between the server and PC and the transfer of computing power to the client is still a tech that's very much in it's early stages and is years away (if not decades) from being mainstream.

Most cloud gaming now is loading the game on the server and downloading it to your hard drive. This means that's you'll still require high end specs for high end games such a Cyberpunk.

If you go on Tesla's web site you can see huge swaths of the country devoid of places to buy the cars.  Meanwhile all other established car makers like GM and even BMW can sell their EV's in all states with no restrictions.  Tesla could migrate to privately franchised dealerships, but that has not been their policy.  The reason these laws got started was to protect dealerships (some of the largest job creators) from having the manufacturer open a place across the street.

Chinese companies received subsidies with no particular fight from Obama and Biden.  So Chinese EVs will receive subsidies to disadvantage Tesla.

Pre-pandemic they were going out of business pretty much. Our local AMC used (10 years ago) to be packed on release nights, preorders only, good luck if you have a group. Last time I went to a release, you could walk up, buy a ticket, and sit a group together with room for bags.

I’ve been to other theaters that are nice. Recliner style sheets with arms that go up. Overall better theater. Same price items, or cheaper. 

People will go to the theater once the pandemic calms down, people are vaccinated, and there’s less concern. But will there be new movies to see? For how long?

Some movies didn’t release in theaters. How’s they do? Did they do better or worse?

How long will it take people to remember they don’t really like going to the movies... and now they don’t need to.

I wouldn’t say this is a P&D. It’s going to go up over time, pretty quickly probably. I’ll be buying in as well. But let’s not pretend the business is going anywhere long term unless they actually improve what they do.

The way they make money is if they go your direction and become profitable and you exercise them OR you can flip them if they begin to trend the right way. 

For example, if you buy a call when a stock is at 40 predicting it will go to 60, you can generally flip it for a partial profit if it starts rising above 40 (before the expiry).",0.073,0.872,0.056,-0.2023

Click that line. It will show you the Options Chain for PLTR. Note the drop down with the date. These are the Expiration Dates. 

Below the date are the different Strike Prices and the Last Price. Other things of importance is Bid (what they will pay you), Ask (what you pay them) and Volume (number of contracts traded). 

The first listed are Calls and ITM (In The Money) and when it changes color that is ATM (At the Money). Anything after the first change in color is OTM(Out of the Money). 

Scroll down and you will see Puts. First come OTM then ATM then ITM. 

When people trade opens (buy or sell), they actually Trade options. You have to because they expire eventually. 

The stock trades at $10. You think it will go up so you Buy a $12 Strike for $1 30 days to expiration (DTE). 

In a week the stock rockets to $15. So your call option is now worth $2.5. So you can Sell to Close (STC) your call and you are Done and you keep $2.5 - $1 or $1.50. 

All these numbers are x100. So you paid $100 and your profit is $150. 

If after a week the stock doesn’t move or goes down, your $1 option might be worth $0.45. Do you buy it back and lose $0.55 or let it ride?

As expiration approaches the stock at $12. Did you win? No. That is because you paid $1 for a $12 strike which adds to $13 so you make money above $13. 

Simple enough?

Also Options are a Sum Zero game. For every winner there is a loser. Unlike stocks. That should put some fear in you.

I added a Paper Trading account at TDA and download Think or Swim. It’s complicated. Overwhelming. Back to YouTube. 

Once you are Consistently made money then start slowly with real money. 

There is a subreddit r/options and r/thetagang that discuss options and there are some Really smart people there so just read it all. 

Just an example of a trade I’m in. 

PLTR was trading in the low 30’s. I’m bullish. So I SOLD a February 19th PUT (last week) for $3 (x100). 

So my breakeven (BE) is 30 - 3 or $27. So I was good with that risk. PLTR is rose to $36 and is above my Put and I’m up $75 right now. I’ll probably make $2 - $2.50 on that trade. Not bad for 3 weeks. 

And with Sold options you can roll them out in time and change the strike price and you can collect more premium than the $3 I already collected. 

I owned 100 shares in CVS and SOLD Covered calls for a year. My shares were finally called away recently. I made $1000 in option premium, $500 on the stock and $200 in dividends. Not bad for a year.

If you want to short, fine, but the thing is that Hollywood has a great big backlog of movies waiting to come out. As more and more people are vaccinated, as the economy picks up and Marvel movies come back and start doing numbers again, then AMC *has* to increase in value. It really can't do much else.  

Their five-year high is something like $15, but they were down to I think $10 before COVID-19 hit. I think they could surpass $10. I don't know. But I genuinely think that if you buy now, that bug the end of the year you'll *at least* double your money. Fuck a short.  

Someone tell me what stock to short my $50 of ""buying power"" on (I should say I have about $250 in Robinhood, again: *do not listen to me*) so I can take the profit and put it back into AMC lolol",0.055,0.83,0.115,0.9337

I started with about $150 and have been putting about $50 in every time I get paid, and I pretty much see that money as spent and gone when I send it over, so psychologically I think I'm all right to lose it haha  

> Are you invested in other stocks, savings, etc?  

okay basically I had a few shares of a cheap ETF but sold it and then didn't withdraw it like I thought I was going to, so I put that back into AMC yesterday and also sold my Disney share to put into AMC. I might dump at least *part* of all that (the rest is about three shares of IMAX, which I will probably never sell: that's a vanity stock, I just god damn love IMAX) but what I'm getting at is that I expect AMC to fluctuate, and probably a lot, before movie studios start doing theatrical releases again, so I will probably sell as much as half of my AMC holdings if it gets closer to $10 this week but my problem is I need somewhere to put *that*  

My understanding is that ETFs are best, but also... idk man it seems pretty obvious that we're in a bubble, and I'm concerned about investing in the DOW Jones if it's just going to crash in a month. So I'm doing a little gambling until the market either stabilizes or implodes so that my money will actually, you know, *increase* in value.  

So basically what I'm doing is blowing $300 or so on practice right now. I don't have a lot of money, this is more about savings than profit, but I feel like I have a good grip on the entertainment industry and feel comfortable playing there.

You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on. That's why the stock suddenly went from $150 to $80 in the space of an hour.

Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. WE'RE WINNING.

The company is a big buyer of customer trades from the leading US retail brokerages such as Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade, which have slashed commissions to zero to keep up with fast-growing challengers such as Robinhood."" https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b

You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on. That's why the stock suddenly went from $150 to $80 in the space of an hour.

Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. WE'RE WINNING.

We saw this stop loss tactic yesterday, and it will happen again today, and the rest of the week too.

TL;DR: GET RID OF YOUR FUCKING STOP LOSSES, OR WE WILL NEVER REACH VALHALLA.

Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders. It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC. That's the same Citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital.

I posted this in another subreddit before, but this my case for AMC:

\-This stock was more than 7$ before covid (And before GIGANTIC amounts of quantitative easing inflated the dollar)

\-Box office sales hit record highs in 2019

\-Streaming TV/Movies did not replace ""going to the movies"", box office sales hit records high in 2019 and watching movies at home had been a thing for years

\-AMC not going bankrupt this year as of yesterday, 900m loan secured

\-Large amount of movies ready to be released in the cinemas

\-People have spent the past year inside, will be eager to do ""social"" things

\-Short interest at 60%+, potential short squeeze happening

Well, that first position was a great one (SE, started buying around $60 stopped at $114) and so I just left it alone to ride and do it's thing. Then again I spread out out into some different stuff and repeated the process.

1147,UK,"I've recently started looking at RR seriously, especially after the fall today. I will probably start pretty small but it does seem like bargain territory. 

RR isn't without risk, but it does have some cool possibilities (I am excited about their modular nuclear technology, for example). 

That said, I picked up a tonne of EasyJet shares at 772 and felt pretty good as it rose to 830, only for it to crash to 720. Every time it looks like we're out of it, there's a problem. However, the UK has now vaccinated 10% of its population, and although there are vaccine supply problems, it seems light is at the end of the tunnel. 

In short, I will put some money at RR, but ""just"" a few hundred for now until I'm more convinced that the turnaround is in progress.",0.084,0.703,0.213,0.9705
