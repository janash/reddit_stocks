Apple is going to market a car in 2024.

QNX makes car software work in EV.

Apple is rumored to be expanding its office in Canada, their current office is right next door to Blackberry/QNX.  Like 50 yards away.  Seriously.

Apple has already siphoned of some of the QNX staff, but not all, and not the source code.

Apple needs QNX software for their EV.

Blackberry has 38,000 patents, with 10,000 of those with the word ‚Äòvehicle‚Äô in the patent.

Apple can use these patents. Apple needs these patents to get into a new car market. They are going to get their ass sued off when they start selling cars.

Tesla could also use these patents. Uber, Ford, GM, BMW, Hyundai, Kia, Toyota, could use these patents. And the QNX software and software team.

Apple is (my guess only) making a bid for Blackberry to scoop up the rest of the QNX team, the source code and the patents. Tesla may be making a counterbid. Other players might be involved. Elon uses the QNX code already in his spacecars.

Position:194 shares at $19.28


Disclaimer: I started trading this January and my views are purely informational and I do not condone anyone making financial/trading decisions based on this post. Do your DD before you trade. This is a bullish take on BB and may have some holes in it.



So I have been watching BB for a while now and feel the company is undervalued. Forgive me as I have not made a DD post before, I failed English in high school, and I am typing this up on my phone.


BB originally caught my attention because it struck me that it survived being primarily a phone company and shifted its business to its cyber security and other software. I Put it on my watch list to swing it a little bit and recently sold 140 shares at $11.


Seeing the price go up and the volume I decided I would jump back in since the trend analysis looked pretty good. Bought in at 19.28 and it almost immediately crashed, I suspect likely due to the pullback the whole market had this morning with stimulus talks being delayed.


Canada Halts trading today due to the volatility followed by BB making a statement in response basically saying idk why investors are buying up the stock we haven‚Äôt made any announcements 
Trading resumes and the price rises back up beyond open in AH, closing at nearly 20 dollars.

THEN as you have already probably seen, BB announces partnership with Baidu - coincidence? Probably not, investors probably coaxed that information out of them and they likely didn‚Äôt want to get caught in some insider trading schenangians. 

Speculation for tomorrow: BB Will open strong and meet or exceed the 40% growth of today since it just got that huge news. Baidu is Chinese google, and they partnered with BB since they need a operating system platform to mass produce their maps software in autonomous/ev vehicles with their partner GAC. Now this is a lot of China talk but BB is headquartered in CANADA which is much friendlier in regards to trade than the U.S.


A little bit of information about GAC, they are a Chinese automotive giant that has came to the United States National Automobile Dealers association expos begging for investors, however has not had much success since the last 4 years have not been good for U.S. and China Trade.


The LONG game: Once our new administration warms up to China after those in charge of trade take their cuts, (and they will because history repeats itself, but right now the bear case would be that Biden is not looking to change tariffs on China, playing tough until he gets some leverage is what I think is really going on) GAC will have lots of opportunity to start putting their vehicles on our roads. 
GAC is the highest rated car brand in China so it may have a chance in the United States if it plays its cards right, which means we could have Blackberry powered Autonomous EVs on our streets in the next 5 years. 

This company has a lot of value in our up and coming future of Electric and Autonomous vehicles.

You absolutely do not have to buy, and if you're holding, I don't care if you sell.  I would rather you do what you believe is best for you.

Should you get in on GME now with all of this insane volatility?  Personally, if I wasn't already in, no, I wouldn't get in now.  But I do genuinely believe there's some high long-term value here.

I'm sorry, but I'm visiting from WSB.  No rockets or profanity here, though, other than me openly admitting that I am a full-on moronic degenerate (I refuse to use some of their more colorful language, even when posting there where it's tolerated).

I've written two pieces of due diligence about GameStop that I believe is valuable not just to short-term investors but also to long-term investors, and there are likely more long-term investors here than are in WSB.  Every now and then some quality DD pops up over there, but it gets buried by memes and shills.  I apologize if this is in poor taste or if this content is better posted in another sub.  This is the only place I could think of with a sizeable membership that might actually give a damn.

If you'd indulge my dumb ass, I invite you to read my research and if you have any comments or constructive criticism on how to write better due diligence, I would be happy to know.

\[GME DD - New leadership, status, X-factors, potential growth\]([https://old.reddit.com/r/runningAndJumping22/comments/l1egkw/gme\_dd\_background\_and\_experience\_of\_new\_leadership/](https://old.reddit.com/r/runningAndJumping22/comments/l1egkw/gme_dd_background_and_experience_of_new_leadership/))

This looks at Ryan Cohen, recent addition to the GME board of directors.  It also looks at where GME currently stands with its (old and busted) business model.  Of interest to investors are some comments on near-term X factors to consider before investing.  Finally, there's napkin math gain/loss potential, as well as a brief list of three potential new business strategies they could execute, none of which are mutually exclusive.

\[Potential strategy analysis - GME/MS partnership\]([https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l47u0y/potential\_gme\_strategy\_component\_online/](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l47u0y/potential_gme_strategy_component_online/))

One potential strategy for GME is analyzed more in depth here - the partnership between GameStop and Microsoft announced in October 2020.  Based on the hypothesis that that relationship might deepen, it explores variations of strategy as that relationship deepens and ultimately arrives to a few endgame strategies for GME to consider.

There is a third piece I have to write that fleshes out what I believe could be GameStop's new set of strategies, and given everything I've read about Mr. Cohen, his history, his bros that he brought with him to the board, and GameStop's current financial position in terms of fcf, assets and global reach, I believe that these strategies make sense and will begin execution probably this year.  Cohen doesn't like twiddling his thumbs.

Again, I'm sorry WSB is leaking.  I'm only sharing because I think it might help.  If this stuff is garbage, hopefully a mod here will spare you and delete this.

I've written two pieces of due diligence about GameStop that I believe is valuable not just to short-term investors but also to long-term investors, and there are likely more long-term investors here than are in WSB.  Every now and then some quality DD pops up over there, but it gets buried by memes and shills.  I apologize if this is in poor taste or if this content is better posted in another sub.  This is the only place I could think of with a sizeable membership that might actually give a damn.

If you'd indulge my dumb ass, I invite you to read my research and if you have any comments or constructive criticism on how to write better due diligence, I would be happy to know.

\[GME DD - New leadership, status, X-factors, potential growth\]([https://old.reddit.com/r/runningAndJumping22/comments/l1egkw/gme\_dd\_background\_and\_experience\_of\_new\_leadership/](https://old.reddit.com/r/runningAndJumping22/comments/l1egkw/gme_dd_background_and_experience_of_new_leadership/))

This looks at Ryan Cohen, recent addition to the GME board of directors.  It also looks at where GME currently stands with its (old and busted) business model.  Of interest to investors are some comments on near-term X factors to consider before investing.  Finally, there's napkin math gain/loss potential, as well as a brief list of three potential new business strategies they could execute, none of which are mutually exclusive.

\[Potential strategy analysis - GME/MS partnership\]([https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l47u0y/potential\_gme\_strategy\_component\_online/](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l47u0y/potential_gme_strategy_component_online/))

One potential strategy for GME is analyzed more in depth here - the partnership between GameStop and Microsoft announced in October 2020.  Based on the hypothesis that that relationship might deepen, it explores variations of strategy as that relationship deepens and ultimately arrives to a few endgame strategies for GME to consider.

There is a third piece I have to write that fleshes out what I believe could be GameStop's new set of strategies, and given everything I've read about Mr. Cohen, his history, his bros that he brought with him to the board, and GameStop's current financial position in terms of fcf, assets and global reach, I believe that these strategies make sense and will begin execution probably this year.  Cohen doesn't like twiddling his thumbs.

Again, I'm sorry WSB is leaking.  I'm only sharing because I think it might help.  If this stuff is garbage, hopefully a mod here will spare you and delete this.

Feedback is welcome.  Thanks for reading this far (or even just this line).

1. The short being squeezed got bailed out today for 2.7 billion. Won‚Äôt have to cover anymore. 

2. Future Gamma squeeze has been cancelled as well because option premiums are way too expensive for it to be possible. 

3. The pump and dump participants are mostly already in. So less and less money is going to buy at higher and higher prices. 

4. ETFS holding GME are now imbalanced (overweight GME) and will need to sell to rebalance. 

5. Institutional holders of GME will also look to rebalance. 

6. GME stock offering is plausible at anytime. 

7. Downside risk is a massive -85% despite all the $1,000 calls it‚Äôs extremely unlikely GME will even kiss $160 again. R/R is very bad particularly if you are holding overnight. We could see a massive top run that takes out all the stops to $40 or even to $20 should some selling pickup.

503,GME,"Large traders were ""shorting"" GME stocks, which is essentially selling a share that you do not currently own on the basis that you will buy it later on when it (hopefully) reduces in price. So they ""shorted"" the stocks at $4 as they expected the stocks to drop in price, when they would later buy the stocks back at let's say $2. Their profit would then be $2 per share.


However, the price has been increasing for various reasons and the shorters pay interest on the stock price until they buy the shares back that they shorted. In addition, there are a very large amount of shorted shares (more than are actually in total circulation). So it's turning into a game of chicken whereby the hedge funds are trying to hold off buying the shares back and everyone else wants to hold on to the shares and drive them higher. If the hedge funds cave and start to buy shares back this will (WSB hopes) cause a cascading upwards price of the stocks as there are so many that need to be bought back to cover their positions.

I don't think this section of your DD is entirely correct.

While yes, there are applications out there that will handle processing power of games server side, that link between the server and PC and the transfer of computing power to the client is still a tech that's very much in it's early stages and is years away (if not decades) from being mainstream.

Most cloud gaming now is loading the game on the server and downloading it to your hard drive. This means that's you'll still require high end specs for high end games such a Cyberpunk.

Tesla is NOT a car manufacturer. They are a renewable energy, alternate transportation, forward thinking company that is heavily focused on technology and disruptive change.

If you go on Tesla's web site you can see huge swaths of the country devoid of places to buy the cars.  Meanwhile all other established car makers like GM and even BMW can sell their EV's in all states with no restrictions.  Tesla could migrate to privately franchised dealerships, but that has not been their policy.  The reason these laws got started was to protect dealerships (some of the largest job creators) from having the manufacturer open a place across the street.

Chinese companies received subsidies with no particular fight from Obama and Biden.  So Chinese EVs will receive subsidies to disadvantage Tesla.

Some movies didn‚Äôt release in theaters. How‚Äôs they do? Did they do better or worse?

How long will it take people to remember they don‚Äôt really like going to the movies... and now they don‚Äôt need to.

The way they make money is if they go your direction and become profitable and you exercise them OR you can flip them if they begin to trend the right way. 

For example, if you buy a call when a stock is at 40 predicting it will go to 60, you can generally flip it for a partial profit if it starts rising above 40 (before the expiry).",0.073,0.872,0.056,-0.2023

Click that line. It will show you the Options Chain for PLTR. Note the drop down with the date. These are the Expiration Dates. 

Below the date are the different Strike Prices and the Last Price. Other things of importance is Bid (what they will pay you), Ask (what you pay them) and Volume (number of contracts traded). 

The first listed are Calls and ITM (In The Money) and when it changes color that is ATM (At the Money). Anything after the first change in color is OTM(Out of the Money). 

Scroll down and you will see Puts. First come OTM then ATM then ITM. 

When people trade opens (buy or sell), they actually Trade options. You have to because they expire eventually. 

The stock trades at $10. You think it will go up so you Buy a $12 Strike for $1 30 days to expiration (DTE). 

In a week the stock rockets to $15. So your call option is now worth $2.5. So you can Sell to Close (STC) your call and you are Done and you keep $2.5 - $1 or $1.50. 

All these numbers are x100. So you paid $100 and your profit is $150. 

If after a week the stock doesn‚Äôt move or goes down, your $1 option might be worth $0.45. Do you buy it back and lose $0.55 or let it ride?

As expiration approaches the stock at $12. Did you win? No. That is because you paid $1 for a $12 strike which adds to $13 so you make money above $13. 

Simple enough?

Also Options are a Sum Zero game. For every winner there is a loser. Unlike stocks. That should put some fear in you. 

Buy a cheap book are read it 3 times. Then watch YouTube videos. You will find people that speak at your level. And then move up. 

I added a Paper Trading account at TDA and download Think or Swim. It‚Äôs complicated. Overwhelming. Back to YouTube. 

Once you are Consistently made money then start slowly with real money. 

There is a subreddit r/options and r/thetagang that discuss options and there are some Really smart people there so just read it all. 

Just an example of a trade I‚Äôm in. 

PLTR was trading in the low 30‚Äôs. I‚Äôm bullish. So I SOLD a February 19th PUT (last week) for $3 (x100). 

So my breakeven (BE) is 30 - 3 or $27. So I was good with that risk. PLTR is rose to $36 and is above my Put and I‚Äôm up $75 right now. I‚Äôll probably make $2 - $2.50 on that trade. Not bad for 3 weeks. 

And with Sold options you can roll them out in time and change the strike price and you can collect more premium than the $3 I already collected. 

I owned 100 shares in CVS and SOLD Covered calls for a year. My shares were finally called away recently. I made $1000 in option premium, $500 on the stock and $200 in dividends. Not bad for a year.

(I am new to this, I am also stupid, I have no idea what I'm talking about, I drive my *own* car for a living do not listen to me)  

AMC is pretty much the last large theater chain in the game, right? And they just received close to a billion dollars in financing over the weekend, so they're not going anywhere unless something *really* bad happens.  

If you want to short, fine, but the thing is that Hollywood has a great big backlog of movies waiting to come out. As more and more people are vaccinated, as the economy picks up and Marvel movies come back and start doing numbers again, then AMC *has* to increase in value. It really can't do much else.  

Their five-year high is something like $15, but they were down to I think $10 before COVID-19 hit. I think they could surpass $10. I don't know. But I genuinely think that if you buy now, that bug the end of the year you'll *at least* double your money. Fuck a short.

> Are you invested in other stocks, savings, etc?  

okay basically I had a few shares of a cheap ETF but sold it and then didn't withdraw it like I thought I was going to, so I put that back into AMC yesterday and also sold my Disney share to put into AMC. I might dump at least *part* of all that (the rest is about three shares of IMAX, which I will probably never sell: that's a vanity stock, I just god damn love IMAX) but what I'm getting at is that I expect AMC to fluctuate, and probably a lot, before movie studios start doing theatrical releases again, so I will probably sell as much as half of my AMC holdings if it gets closer to $10 this week but my problem is I need somewhere to put *that*  

My understanding is that ETFs are best, but also... idk man it seems pretty obvious that we're in a bubble, and I'm concerned about investing in the DOW Jones if it's just going to crash in a month.

Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders. It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC. That's the same Citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital.

Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade and other brokerages to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.

""Chicago-based Citadel Securities accounts for 40 of every 100 shares traded by individual investors in the US, making it the number one retail market maker, according to Piper Sandler. The company is a big buyer of customer trades from the leading US retail brokerages such as Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade, which have slashed commissions to zero to keep up with fast-growing challengers such as Robinhood."" https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b

You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on. That's why the stock suddenly went from $150 to $80 in the space of an hour.

Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. WE'RE WINNING.

We saw this stop loss tactic yesterday, and it will happen again today, and the rest of the week too.

TL;DR: GET RID OF YOUR FUCKING STOP LOSSES, OR WE WILL NEVER REACH VALHALLA.

I‚Äôm now up I think 4000%. If you have a plan and you‚Äôre bleeding, definitely re-evaluate and if the plans basis seems to be no longer sensible then take your money and run. But If the thesis still seems correct and you‚Äôre just hurting over the loss see it through and hold! 

This goes along with never investing money on a speculative investment that you aren‚Äôt okay with losing. When I went in on it I did my max available allocated for gambling but contemplated putting in a bunch more I couldn‚Äôt afford to lose. I didn‚Äôt. Yes, I‚Äôd have more now if I had but I probably wouldn‚Äôt have held for the month it was at 13.

I‚Äôm not saying hold through any dip always, that‚Äôs a great way to confirmation bias your way to 0. What I am saying is:

- have a clearly defined plan BEFORE you spend the money
- don‚Äôt invest so much that you can‚Äôt lose it if the plan takes time. Most good investments take time.
- when the hurt happens, re-evaluate the PLAN with new information. Your losses aren‚Äôt relevant. What matters  is if new information has come out that contraindicates your plans reasoning.",0.103,0.768,0.129,0.7803
