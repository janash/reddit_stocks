1,GE," I don't have big money at play, so a few stocks here and there.  With the upcoming GE reverse split - I don't have 8 shares (right now 6.5) so it won't convert and will be sold.  Would I be better off adding that last 1.5 shares, selling now, or waiting for the inevitable sell?   Looking for some thoughts.  thanks.",zombiereign,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/opz8vb/daily_discussion_thread_july_23rd_2021/h68zkp8/,0.062,0.804,0.134,0.6623
