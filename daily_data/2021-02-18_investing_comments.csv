3,RIOT," RIOT is pretty risky in such a bull run for Bitcoin. There's no knowing when a correction will occur and how big of a correction it will be. RIOT share price basically follows Bitcoin's price it could end up back to being a penny stock in no time (52 week low was .51 cents!) I think you'd be better off just buying Bitcoin instead, if the coin crashes at least you'll still have some crypto to hold on to vs. the possibility of RIOT going out of business after a crash and ending up with nothing.",1o010o1,38,/r/investing/comments/lmk8f3/due_diligence_of_bitcoin_mining_stock_valuations/gnvwoh6/,0.218,0.708,0.074,-0.9432

36,DD," All the while DD is great, thanks for writing this up. I would like to point out the fallacy, or plain wrong smoke and mirrors, which is the belief that this time it is institutions and big hedge funds buying up (and therefore the price increase) all the bitcoin. 

 Here is the thing:

The 2017 mania was Gartner hype cycle peak and what followed would have (at best) reached plateau of productivity (perhaps half of all time high after many years). Back then, the retail mania was legitimate (although even back then, tether spiced up the price here and there, but nothing comparable what is going on this time around). Crypto enthusiasts act vindicated after 2020, all the while conveniently glossing over the fact, that without \~30B empty air + defi leverage billions, it would have continued to fizzle into abyss as hundreds similar Gartner hype cycles before and after crypto. Those who are not aware, here are few facts to think about:

\- Through last 11 months, Tether (which, in kind wording, is sketchy as FUCK entity that is like federal reserve of crypto assets on steroids) has printed 88% of their all historic circulating supply/\~29B worth of dollars, which are always soon after transfered into major crypto exchanges (Binance, Huobi etc.), purchased bitcoins and offloaded to ""unknown wallets"". It is an entity, which has never had official audit done nor are very highly unlikely to have almost no dollar backing. Hilarious is though, that they are backed to a degree by those bitcoins that they just bought with ""minted"" dollars. Ridiculous nature in which you print out of thin air, purchase an asset, that then pumps in price, offering you further collateral in the form of bitcoin, followed by another and another round of tether minting to further pump up the price of bitcoin ad infinitum.

\- Also consider the fact, that in greed periods of markets, notoriously thin order books in crypto mean, that dollar : MC ratio is at the very least 1:30, which essentially means, that those currently printed 33B worth of tether already account to 2/3 of total crypto asset class market cap. And this is not taking into account other stable coins, which have also increased in 2020 time period in billions. Those stable coins in nature are similar to tether, as they use something called defi, which in Laymans terms means, that crypto participants use their crypto as a collateral, with interest, to further ""mint"" more stable coins for themselves, which they then use to purchase more crypto. It is basically usual leverage that exchanges offer. The whole thing is such a ugly house of cards, that the fallout will be horrible for usual retail participants.

Its a ponzi, blatant fraud and will end ugly for majority of participants.

All these things considered, considering the nature of pump and dump of crypto, even something as simple as looking at the yearly price chart, the business model for both RIOT and MARA will be short lived. As you stated of course, timing is difficult, tether could manipulate the price further into million, but the fallout once the manipulation and no real fiat in the system, will result in collapse of the price and both mentioned stocks and their business model. I personally have already purchased long term puts and will continue doing so.

As you stated of course, timing is difficult, tether could manipulate the price further into million, but the fallout once the manipulation and no real fiat in the system, will result in collapse of the price and both mentioned stocks and their business model.

>In this instance, you are paying the executive team of MARA and RIOT to buy the hardware, plug it in, and sell any bitcoin for you. There isn't much more to it than that - you could buy the hardware yourself and run a few machines if you found a good electric company to partner with for cheap electricity.

The post completely ignores that MARA and a few other miners (but mostly mara) have basically bought up the entire ASIC supply a year out. 

You can't just walk to the ASIC store and buy a pallet of S9's and start competing with them. 

And it's acting like finding a ""good electric company to partner with for cheap electricity"" is trivial. The top miners have scoured locations and facilities with sufficient infrastructure and made long term deals to get dirt cheap electricity. No one's going to set up a hut next to Niagra Falls and plug in their ASICs from the ASIC store. 

These are huge competitive moats being dismissed like they're nothing. It's like saying I could just buy a truck & drill and mine gold so only fools invest in gold miners. 

>However, it went up a massive 600% over the following 9 months as new miners were produced and deployed **with a lag**.

The lag is the whole point!

There are two semiconductor foundries on the planet for ASIC chips and they are booked up for ages. 

Yes, *eventually* the intractible triple semiconductor, ASIC, and power bottleneck will be relieved...after you miss the massive opportunity these are producing. 

Bitcoin mining stocks are a short term leveraged play that you should move into BTC before the four year halving cycle top (if the supercycle scenario plays out then strap in). It's all about the time frame, not binary good/bad. No one is saying these are generational blue chips. 

During the down cycle the smart companies with cash piles from the bull market will then buy used miners from smaller players for fire sale prices. So maybe some of these will become blue chips.

90,MARA," I'm with you on this, completely lost to the details, I've had people explain it to me like i'm 5, and it only confused me more to be honest.

Fortunately someone who is at least 6 told me to buy MARA at $4 and I dam near sold it at 2, but said what the hell, then BTC went loco and I rode the wave up.  Ended up exiting at 16 and was pretty happy with the results, but dam I wish I had left a couple hundred shares in to ride it up to the 40's. 

My theory is that even if I don't understand the whole coin thing that it made sense to invest in companies and people that actually do understand it, and profit off their knowledge.

Bitcoin will crash again, in my opinion, and that will be another time to buy into Riot, IMO. Why? Because I always think Bitcoin will go back up. I never said up to its ATH but up nonetheless.

Riot profits if BTC goes up, but imo there is a limit.

116,MARA," It's not. It handwaves away *massive* assumptions. 

>In this instance, you are paying the executive team of MARA and RIOT to buy the hardware, plug it in, and sell any bitcoin for you. There isn't much more to it than that - you could buy the hardware yourself and run a few machines if you found a good electric company to partner with for cheap electricity.

The post completely ignores that MARA and a few other miners (but mostly mara) have basically bought up the entire ASIC supply a year out. 

You can't just walk to the ASIC store and buy a pallet of S9's and start competing with them. 

And it's acting like finding a ""good electric company to partner with for cheap electricity"" is trivial. The top miners have scoured locations and facilities with sufficient infrastructure and made long term deals to get dirt cheap electricity. No one's going to set up a hut next to Niagra Falls and plug in their ASICs from the ASIC store. 

These are huge competitive moats being dismissed like they're nothing. It's like saying I could just buy a truck & drill and mine gold so only fools invest in gold miners. 

>However, it went up a massive 600% over the following 9 months as new miners were produced and deployed **with a lag**.

The lag is the whole point!

There are two semiconductor foundries on the planet for ASIC chips and they are booked up for ages. 

Yes, *eventually* the intractible triple semiconductor, ASIC, and power bottleneck will be relieved...after you miss the massive opportunity these are producing. 

Bitcoin mining stocks are a short term leveraged play that you should move into BTC before the four year halving cycle top (if the supercycle scenario plays out then strap in). It's all about the time frame, not binary good/bad. No one is saying these are generational blue chips. 

If you want some legitimate analysis of the bitcoin mining space check out the [Blonity Analytics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPJvLknI9JEwW_p4m8xaAow/featured) youtube channel. MARA is decent to a little overextended, but the best deals right now are the Canadian miners that haven't hit NASDAQ if you have a real broker.

I'm curious how their next quarterly report looks - the monthly updates only provide revenue, so of course no depreciation of their mining machines is included (which have about 2 years of profitability).

As OP pointed out these miners will keep diluting shares to continuously replace their mining machines; the result being very small net margins at best.

130,ATH," Because bitcoin (and crypto asset class on a larger scale really) cult has this belief in the 4 year cycle, which they strongly believe in. I would even go as far as to say that this is the most important pillar of belief for this particular group of people. They believe, that mining reward halving after each 4 years is what will cause at least tenfold increase from last ATH levels and as this has happened few times in the past, it will continue also into the future (until bitcoin becomes world currency/asset). Last spring, halving caused daily new minted bitcoin reward to drop from 1800 to 900, which means ~330 000 bitcoins less per year. Which might sound like significant amount, and to some degree sure there is small effect on the yearly inflation, however ~30B unbacked tether, that started purchasing bitcoins off exchanges from last spring throughout last 11 months, from the low end of 4500 per bitcoin all the way to today around 50k. Lets say tether scammers have average cost basis of 25 000 through this time period, which would alone mean that this entity took 1.2 million bitcoins out of the circulation, which does not take into account all the defi leverage and other stable coins with billions of new mints.

He also coined the phrase ""ten bagger"" in a financial context. 

The PEG ratio is considered to be a convenient approximation. ... It was later popularized by Peter Lynch, who wrote in his 1989 book One Up on Wall Street that ""The P/E ratio of any company that's fairly priced will equal its growth rate"", i.e., a fairly valued company will have its PEG equal to 1.

203,MC," 100% agree with you on this. 

The 2017 mania was Gartner hype cycle peak and what followed would have (at best) reached plateau of productivity (perhaps half of all time high after many years). Crypto enthusiasts act vindicated after 2020, all the while conveniently glossing over the fact, that without \~30B empty air + defi leverage billions, it would have continued to fizzle into abyss as hundreds similar Gartner hype cycles before and after crypto. Those who are not aware, here are few facts to think about:

\- Through last 11 months, Tether (which, in kind wording, is sketchy as FUCK entity that is like federal reserve of crypto assets on steroids) has printed 88% of their all historic circulating supply/\~29B worth of dollars, which are always soon after transfered into major crypto exchanges (Binance, Huobi etc.), purchased bitcoins and offloaded to ""unknown wallets"". It is an entity, which has never had official audit done nor are very highly unlikely to have almost no dollar backing. Hilarious is though, that they are backed to a degree by those bitcoins that they just bought with ""minted"" dollars. Ridiculous nature in which you print out of thin air, purchase an asset, that then pumps in price, offering you further collateral in the form of bitcoin, followed by another and another round of tether minting to further pump up the price of bitcoin ad infinitum.

\- Also consider the fact, that in greed periods of markets, notoriously thin order books in crypto mean, that dollar : MC ratio is at the very least 1:30, which essentially means, that those currently printed 33B worth of tether already account to 2/3 of total crypto asset class market cap. And this is not taking into account other stable coins, which have also increased in 2020 time period in billions. Those stable coins in nature are similar to tether, as they use something called defi, which in Laymans terms means, that crypto participants use their crypto as a collateral, with interest, to further ""mint"" more stable coins for themselves, which they then use to purchase more crypto. It is basically usual leverage that exchanges offer. The whole thing is such a ugly house of cards, that the fallout will be horrible for usual retail participants.

Edited to say: there may be some concern about the merger being renegotiated and possibly not happening. If the merger doesn't happen, the jilted party must be paid $50 million.

Israel was on the path the legalization for recreational use. It apparently hasn't happened yet, but weed is highly decriminalized.

249,UK," Hey, new here (and to investing in general). It's been interesting and eye-opening to read all of your posts over the last couple of weeks. I'm learning a lot, doing as much reading and research as I can. I guess my main observation at the moment is how overvalued many US stocks are, it's kind of mindblowing. I'm definitely getting a sense of how crazy the market is right now compared to normal (whatever that is nowadays).

I've started my portfolio with a small investment in INRG which I'm intending to top up frequently and hold for the next 10-ish years. I've also thrown a bit of money into KNB - an Israeli cannabis company, and the first cannabis company to list on the LSE. This was mostly for fun as the shares were so cheap, but also because of the sector's huge growth potential. The US cannabis industry is light years ahead of us here in the UK, but I think we will slowly come round. And Europe is already making progress.",Saffbop,1,/r/investing/comments/lmjbev/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gnvfo1i/,0.01,0.883,0.107,0.9349

-Can the Nasdaq build strongly on 14k?

-Can semiconductors build on the breakout from last week?
-Can big tech like AMZN break higher?

261,BKEP,"  Any thoughts out there on BKEP? Looks to have good cash flow and will be positioned better once they complete the sale of their less profitable assets. From what I've read they are going to lean into their niche of asphalt terminalling, all while selling their pipeline and crude storage assets which haven't been that great for them. Their GP, Ergon, can drop down many more assets in the asphalt storage realm and be a win-win for both them and BKEP. It's held strong over the last few days in spite of the market. Plus it's got a 7% dividend yield. Seems like a good buy and upside.

272,DIS," Being impatient. 

Assuming you're investing with money that you can afford to lose, if you're looking to make long-term gains, have a long-term view and don't get discouraged by short-term, daily fluctuations in price. If you truly believe in the impact that these companies/holdings will have in 1, 2, 5, or even 10 years, then invest and only monitor/adjust periodically (i.e. check once a week, month, quarter).

Watching price changes on an hour-to-hour basis and checking your portfolio 18x a day can be mentally and emotionally draining and possibly cause you to make emotionally-charged mistakes that a more logical, analytical you wouldn't have made.

Especially for more innovative or ""newer"" industries where their earning capability is still maturing, you may have to go along for a bit of a ride before you see notable gains. However, if you did your research and have faith in the companies'/industries' growth, time in market will usually win out.

Personal case in point, I invested in DIS when Disney+ was first launched in Nov '19 because I thought it had huge potential to rival the other giant streaming services out there. It wasn't until a year later in Nov '20 that I was in the green again, and now I'm up about 30% on my investment. But keep in mind that within that timeline, at one point I was 40% in the red and kicking myself at my ""luck"" for buying DIS at almost its 52-week high at the point of purchase.

306,IT,"  I’ve recently taken an interest in investing due to recent events here on Reddit. While my friends seem to approach the topic by either blindly investing in hyped stocks or spending a lot of time researching individual stocks, this method seems either too risky or time consuming.

I am a 23 years old IT student from Germany. While my basic costs get covered by my lovely parents, I also work for a small web design company on a 450€ basis that I currently directly transfer into my savings account. I have accumulated the humble amount of 3000€ in savings now and wonder how I could invest that money in a safe way with decent returns.

I’ve recently read John Bogle’s “Little Book of Common Sense Investing” which talks about the advantages of index funds. Index funds have also been coming up a lot in Reddit conversations and I’ve even read about  up to 10% return rates multiple times in that context.

My plan is not to get rich in my late 20s by investing (I’ll try to take on that dream with hard work and finishing my bachelor then master in IT). I want to slowly but steadily have my saved up money working for me with low risk and decent rewards.

* Are index funds the way to go for a young inexperienced investor like me?
* Which index funds should I consider the most? What are red flags to look out for? What kind of return rated should I expect?
* What other ways of investing should I consider?
* What other books or sources of information do you recomend?

307,USA," I am looking for investment advice to help my parents. They have retired just recently and are looking to protect their life savings from a possible crisis. They need help and am not sure exactly what would be the safest options right now. The stock market is in my opinion massively overvalued and is in a bubble. The metals are also almost higher priced than ever. Keeping cash would be problematic with possible massive inflation coming up in the future due to all the printing of money for Covid in the USA and elsewhere. It is also my understanding that bonds are also negatively affected by inflation, or in the case that interest rates go up. Which leaves us with what exactly?

&#x200B;

My  thoughts would be a lot of diversification, something like 35% stocks, 35% bonds, 10% metals and 20% cash. This way at least they are more hedged from keeping all their eggs in one basket. They are incredibly risk averse and would like the safest choices available, growth is not something they are interested in, only protection of their assets. They are very against stocks in general, think it too risky and so far they have been mostly having cash and bonds. This has worked for them in the sense that they felt the safety of protecting their capital despite losing some to inflation when inflation wasn't that high over the past few years. But recently with the Covid and all that stimulus going on, inflation may end up becoming a significant concern, to the point that keeping everything in cash and bonds may end up being riskier than having some exposure to the stock market even. What are yours thoughts and advice? What would be the safest way to fight inflation and have the ""safest portfolio"" one could reasonably have without caring for growth?

314,GE," GE good stock as nuclear energy demand (maybe) goes up in the United States?

I’ve been holding GE as it’s a staple in aerospace, household appliances, and energy. It’s low right now and GE as a company has been going through it lol. But I do think they can bounce back. They sold a large amount of their healthcare sector that was worth a majority of what their company was, but it seems to be the right decision to get them back on track. They have payed a massive amount of debt off and have entered into a few deals for jet turbine engines that will allow for a large profit in the coming years. 

I also recently learned about the GE Hitachi alliance (GEH) that is a heavy supplier of nuclear energy (either in the US or worldwide), which is promising for the coming years of advanced demand for nuclear energy in comparison to energy used now. Although public sentiment is very against nuclear energy because of ignorance, there is a chance that scientists and public figures like bill gates can sway opinion and put nuclear energy into a good light for the public.

320,DD," Hi everyone. Just joined the subreddit. I have a few questions about ETFs and what would be a good route for me for my future. I’ve tried to do some stock trading over the last 2 years and it has been ok but I mostly invested into long term plays. Tried my hand at shorter term trades and was down about 1000$ because i just got nervous with the ups and downs and ended up selling too early. Looking back my DD was actually pretty good and if I would’ve just stuck it out on a few trades that 1000$ in the hole would’ve been pretty good return. Unfortunately I just don’t think active trading is for me. I have a 60,000 year job in Canada. I’m 36. No kids and no wife. I have a unique situation where I moved back into my moms at 33 because she got a brain tumor. My bills amount to 150$ month and no rent. I’m probably close to getting a promotion at work which would push me to 75K yearly. Take home pay after taxes is prob 3500 average monthly. I jumped into a few ETFs already. ARKK which I know is higher risk and QQQJ. I have some shares in Disney and Nvidia and Corsair which I got cheap for long term hold. What other ETFs should I be looking at to diversify?

333,IT," > I've been looking at ARK funds a lot recently, and I am more or less convinced that insofar as a ""safe fund with high return"" goes, it really can't be beat.

Based on what? 

The [three oldest ARK funds](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=2&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2019&lastMonth=10&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=ARKK&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=ARKQ&allocation2_2=100&symbol3=ARKW&allocation3_3=100) each did nice enough for it's first six years of life (ARKK an 18.33% CAGR, ARKQ 11.9%, and ARKW 24.48%), but they all basically just looked like a play on the IT sector. Indeed, FTEC, Fidelity's generic IT sector ETF, [posted an 18.03% CAGR over the same period](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=2&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2019&lastMonth=10&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=ARKK&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=ARKQ&allocation2_2=100&symbol3=FTEC&allocation3_3=100). They've all then absolutely exploded in the last year. Some of that is just the IT sector (FTEC is up ~45% Nov 2019 to now). Now, they've certainly had incredible returns in that ~1 year (even handily beating something like FTEC, e.g.), but that's literally one year of returns. 

Much the same story with the other funds. ARKW (just a few days younger) was basically giving you index fund returns (9.78% CAGR) for its first 5+ years of life (Nov '14 to March '20) despite being an astronomically riskier play (with just low double digit holdings), but again exploded this past year. Hell, ARKF (the newest fund) was actually *down* across it's first year (March 2019 - March 2020), but has shot up this past year.

E.g., Tesla is the top holding (by a lot) of ARKK, ARKQ, and ARKW and, whaddya know, had a meteoric rise right in line with their past year of success. Why is their one year of success a sign that they're a good bet, and not just a sign that they hit on a Tesla play?

To me, they look much more like a fund company that has had a good year. But past returns are not a guarantee of future results. Can you describe why you think they ""can't be beat"" without simply referencing their past returns? What about this fund management team makes you think they're going to consistently beat their equivalent market after fees [when essentially nobody does](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/more-evidence-that-its-really-hard-to-beat-the-market-over-time-95-of-finance-professionals-cant-do-it/)?",throwawayinvestacct,2,/r/investing/comments/lmjaly/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gnxexhi/,0.05,0.809,0.141,0.9857
334,EH," When did you invest $200 into each of these stocks? You're down 150 total, but you're still at 850. Does losing another 150 cripple you? If so that's not good and means you probably shouldn't invest at all.

338,ABC," I am a n00b but here's my shot. Options = calls and puts.

A call = a contract in the future that you buy if you think a stock price will increase

A put = a contract in the future that you buy if you think a stock price will decrease

&#x200B;

You can also sell options, which is the opposite of above but for simplicity sake lets just talk about buying them since that's what most new people do. 

Each option has a premium, you pay this no matter what

Say you buy a call for company ABC which currently trades at 10 dollars. Your call is for 14 days and the strike price is 12 dollars. If the company at 2 weeks time trades at 14 dollars you are ""in the money"" and your profit would be that your cost basis for the call option is $12 instead of if you bought it that day at $14 (of course you have to pay a premium so factor that into your profit)

&#x200B;

A put is the opposite, say you buy a put for company ABC which currently trades at $10. Your put is 14 days and you think the company will be worth $8. If the company is worth $6 at 14 days you are in the money

&#x200B;

Options are contracts that you do not need to fulfill so if your call or put is out of the money you do not need to fulfill the contract but you do have to pay the premium regardless. In addition, most people do not end up buying the shares of company ABC even if they're in the money, instead they sell their options contract if they're in the money for a profit, which would be the difference in the premium they receive vs what they paid.

That's a nice move. Whether luck or not, this is quite far above what people on reddit are going to achieve.

CRM is going to be affected by how the later stages of COVID play out. (I realise that's an extremely obvious statement, apologies if it comes across as condescending). If you're willing to ride the short term risk, it is probably worth just waiting and seeing what happens to the market when companies get the option of going back into the office, etc.

Longer term risk matters too. CRM is a decent stock, but its still an individual stock. That comes with risk on both sides. If you are working towards a particular target (house payment or whatever) and don't want to suffer potential 10% losses for potential 15% gains, you could look to take some of your position out and move it into something more stable like an ETF or bond.

You are almost certainly right about this - that kind of bio technology is the future.

What you (or I) can't know (unless you've done a lot more research than I realise) is which company or companies are going to successfully enter this kind of bio-healthcare research space first, and which are going to do it the best/ with the best profit margins. It could definitely be SANA (and you would most likely get a massive return if it is). It could also be another company. If SANA fail to get in there early enough, or if SANA hit their own internal problems (funding, research or otherwise), then the value of the stock could drop.

I don't know enough about the space and SANA specifically to tell you about specifics of various parameters and what I think of them. But I will say that it is a pretty risky/ volatile move. Again, risky means risky in both directions. If you're happy for this ~$1k investment to largely disappear then you can accept that risk.

But in the long run the current market isn’t sustainable.

Market is already pricing in the demise of gas, ICE cars, weed and psychedelics to capture the whole vice market, crypto to replace currency, etc. etc. 

And people keep chasing riskier and riskier assets to capture short term gains, further driving up valuations on these incredibly risky assets. And then these companies dilute their shares to raise more capital, which people still gobble up. 

The market has been propped up by the Fed and by zero interest rates. But the thing is that inflation and interest rates have been increasing - so continuing to assume that people have nowhere else to put their money besides stocks, isn’t as valid as it was before. Furthermore when you start to model higher interest rates in valuations, well then valuations start to drop. 

So maybe the correction isnt starting now, maybe it’s just a dip. But either way I think it’s past due that this frothy market will soon come down, whether it be gradually or abruptly.

359,AKAM," Dont join on those who are over 30% because those are positions that i sometime close early for a fast profit, i opened most of them and was on red first 2 days,  AKAM went to - 30% at some time because of the leverage even if now its on green :)",eni1993,1,/r/investing/comments/lm6x3q/new_week_new_shortmid_range_investments/gnvboaq/,0.036,0.85,0.114,0.6139
360,CC," I've been writing CC on this stock and keep getting burned around earnings. No idea how they keep beating the Street by such a wide margin. 

Just curious, why do you want the 10Q so badly? What info does it have that the PR and call didn't disclose?",sorengard123,3,/r/investing/comments/lmdvzf/twilio_up_premarket_after_q4_earnings/gnv1xpg/,0.165,0.707,0.128,-0.4798

362,NBA, This is such a masked shill for NBA top shot. Literallly nobody gives a shit about any of this stuff and you just happen to suddenly want this weird unusual thing that *gasp* someone just started promoting all over the place,UpDown,1,/r/investing/comments/lmbn21/digital_assets_besides_stocks_bonds_and/gnwr44s/,0.121,0.754,0.124,-0.2204

364,NBA, It’s all about scarcity and utilizing blockchain technology. There are a limited amount of cards/moments and you can prove exactly which one you have. There’s already a huge market for it. It is an experimental field but I do believe it is going to blow up especially because it’s directly endorsed by the NBA.,PrinceWhoPromes,2,/r/investing/comments/lmbn21/digital_assets_besides_stocks_bonds_and/gnvs37x/,0.027,0.896,0.077,0.4019
365,DD," Not the most thorough DD I’ve read, and I’m not sure I’d invest in a company that solely produces social media filters... but I get where you’re going. Digital Avatars/Digital Life/Augmented Reality is where this planet will lean one day (Hopefully we don’t get fat and useless like in WALL -E) but  I’m just not sure how far away that all is. 

TLDR; Sounds like you’re interested in companies developing augmented reality.",dneboi,3,/r/investing/comments/lmnh4j/digital_fashion_my_thoughts/gnwd3ql/,0.093,0.784,0.123,0.5308
