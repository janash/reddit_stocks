0,PV," I work in CMBS for a fortune 500 bank and I am interested in hearing about why you expect a deterioration in cash flow.


Anecdotally from my perspective, CMBS is quite strong right now relative to the past 2-3 years. Low discount rates and thin credit spread pricing above treasuries on equal terms to maturity yield high gain on sale. Steepening yield curve improves the net present value of mortgage servicing rights. PV MSR represents at least 40% of overall CMBS profitability.


As far as investor appetite, pensions and life insurance companies continue to love to buy up freddie k series, CMBS conduit/SASB transactions.


Our only concern right now is the decline of retail and hospitality property types. The market has shifted towards multifamily, industrial and self storage. Fannie and Freddie can price multi more aggressively with higher leverage and lower coupons than conduit can, so they are able to win most of the multifamily market share. Banks are being ultra competitive on quoting small and mid sized assets (5-10 million) to round out their collateral for pools.

4,IMO," It's pretty clear the market is very mixed but I am concerned mainly with 3 things.

1.  Corporate HQ and Office.  Literally everyone is or has been rethinking their needs in this environment.  It's too early to tell what the ultimate outcome will be.  But this could be the very beginnings of a trend to essentially move the cost burden for ""office"" from the employer to the employee.  People are talking about how much energy bitcoin uses.  Wait till they start talking about commuting.  Will we eventually see companies environmentally shamed for having their employees commute long distances for a job that could be done from home?   Ultimately, the upside for WFH was always clear.  The downside was the risks of trying it on a wide scale were too great.  Well we've crossed that bridge and it wasn't terrible - and it's getting better every day.  I could go on but I'll keep it short
2. Retail.  We simply have too much retail space.  It's going to be up and down based on consumer spending (which is really strong right now due to stimulus).  But the ultimate trend is downward due to more eCommerce.   Now that everyone shopped online last holiday, how many people are going to just keep doing it?  The holidays are always so busy....
3. Gas stations.  It's a dead category IMO.  Ev's are here, the adoption curve is going to be similar to smartphones in liberal areas and slower in conservative ones.  But it will happen, the future is clear on this.  Ford is onboard.  There is going to be absolute carnage in this category in 10 years.    Also, gas stations can't just convert to charging stations.  Maybe 1 in 50 can.  Most charging is done at home.  

Also dense residential is troubling if #1 takes off.  If you need a home office, you're going to need more space at home and you're going to spend way more time there.

6,AP," I gave the article a quick scan, and I'll be honest here: I was very disappointed in its quality. Pretty much everything in that article was either incorrect or misleading. I have significant difficulty believe that this was written by someone with even an elementary understanding of the industry.

The author's main argument was that the assets behind CMBS were overvalued because their net operating income (NOI) was systematically overestimated by a significant amount through the use of a metric called ""underwritten NOI"". However, a deeper dive into the study they quoted brings significant doubt into this thesis. From the study The Intercept quoted:

that underwritten NOI is “meant to reflect the stable and consistent net operating income of the property.”

In other words, underwritten NOI differs from NOI in order to smooth out one-time fluctuations in an asset's operating income. For example, if you have a burst pipe in your commercial building, your ""real"" NOI would be lower since it would cost you quite a bit to fix it. However, that's a one-time expense. Your pipes shouldn't be bursting every year. This differs from recurring costs such as security expenses or cleaning expenses. You might also get unexpected NOI that shouldn't be included in underwritten NOI. For example, if a tenant decides to abandon their lease and pays a termination fee, that termination fee would be included as NOI. However, it should not be included as underwritten NOI. When you value a property, it makes more sense to exclude these one-time income/expenses and use underwritten NOI. This seems perfectly logical. In fact, I would argue that not doing this would be illogical. Furthermore, they write that “actual net operating income falls short of underwritten income by 5% or more in 28% of loans.” These relatively small fluctuations are not at all concerning to me, especially since most CMBS are overcollateralized by more than that.

Finally, I would strongly advise you against making investment decisions based on what you read in publications like The Intercept, Fox, or The New Yorker. While they attempt to appear as credible financial advice, they are most certainly anything but. I would instead recommend WSJ (excluding opinions), Bloomberg (excluding anything other than Bloomberg News and Bloomberg Law), Reuters, FT, and AP.",rob_shi,3,/r/investing/comments/nnjk2n/is_it_possible_to_invest_in_or_short_either/gzwp2up/,0.042,0.889,0.068,0.7729

40,JNJ," I'm a huge value investors. I only buy dividend stock.

I seek :

1 : long term solvability

2 : Ability to pay dividend

3 : Ability to take on debt if need to pay dividend.

4 : ability to growth (could be through acquisition).

5 : Interest rate of the dividend

6 : Macro econ analysis to choose when to buy cyclical and when not to.

Than I wait for my dividend and the slow growth. My goal is 10% per year with low risk. Up to now, I do it every year. Some year, I get lucky and make more. (this year I make 41%)

My way of thinking is that there's more bad years than good years so if you can make 8-10% in a bad year, your golden with compounded interest.

Right now, I own pepsi, tabaco, railroad, commodity (currently oil and mining), tellecommunication.

44,ROIC," I'm still a wet-behind-the-ears investor.  I started at the beginning of the year on a personal portfolio, outside of my employer 401k program.

I figured if I was going to do this I should probably try to pattern off the big names we all know, Buffett and Munger.  So I try to follow 4 principles they espouse.  1) Can I understand the company?  2) Does it have intrinsic characteristics that give it durable competitive advantage(s)?  3) Does the management have integrity and talent?  4) Is the business available for a fair price and give a sufficient “margin of safety”?

I'll read a couple sections of the latest 10K to see if I can generally understand how they make money and what are the specific risks the company faces.  I'll also read recent articles to see if there are identifiable issues/risks analysts are identifying and try to dig into those things a little more.

I try to identify what they think their competitive advantages are from the 10k and again read articles to see if other professionals agree or have other ideas.  Measuring the durability of those advantages is a little more difficult for me right now, but I'm working on it.

I find the management team question to be the most difficult.  I tend to look at how much debt they're racking up and how they are using it, and if ROE and ROIC are any good.  I mean, if the CEO's name is Bernie Madoff, then I'm probably not investing.... Short of that, I'm still figuring this one out.

The fair price question gets into the fundamentals and compounded growth.  I try to look back 5-10 years, and look at CAGR in 2-3 different intervals from present.  Then I check out what analysts think the 5 year future growth will be and run 2 different discounted valuations.  

Then I apply a big 'ole margin of safety of 40-50% to whatever valuations I came up with because I'm wrong somewhere in all of the above....

Other than that, I'm reading The Intelligent Investor, by Graham right now.  I've got essays and transcripts to read from Buffett and Munger.  Quick aside, Munger is more fun reading in my opinion.  I'd like to read Mohnish Pabrai at some point, and I've listened to one of Peter Lynch's books on audio.",Yo_Biff,1,/r/investing/comments/nnb85e/what_is_your_due_diligence_criteria/gzvn3qu/,0.035,0.852,0.113,0.9799

Also their management fee of 0.75% for an actively managed fund that puts in way more time and research then I am able to is totally worth it.

61,AMD," Intel has been growing their fcf at about 9% a year going back 10 or 11 years (don't remember how far back I went.) Gross profit, earnings, revenue, etc.. are also growing, so the ""dying company"" argument has no merit. Obviously not a dying industry either. My projections, which were lower than analysts projections, have you more than doubling your money in the next 10 years if you bought the entire company outright, then of course you'd still own the company after that.

Lots of nonsense about them losing the apple contract. Apple is 1-3% of their revenue depending on the year. With the current demand, they can EASILY make that up like it didn't even happen.

New ceo was their cto before they started losing market share. He stopped being the technology officer just a few years before they really started losing market share. He's now the CEO and focusing on improving production and product quality and they're already putting more money into those in his first few months in charge.

More cash on hand than AMD has done in revenue their last 3 years combined, so they have plenty of money to put into improving product and production quality.

What happens by next year if Intel revenue is flat yet again, or even down while the other two have over 50% revenue growth? And what if this continues as Intel cannot catch up?

74,AMD," I think Intel is stagnant, mostly due to the security flaws spectre / meltdown, which didn't affect AMD as bad (though still impacted). Until that issue is solved, either by some new architecture or some mitigating response, I don't think Intel will make a comeback to where it was.

Nevertheless, I do think the security flaws will be appropriately addressed in the future. Thus, I bought-in at 50/share and holding tight. My guess is probably within 10 years there should be a nice return (maybe a 10 bagger). How so?

Just before the March 2018 announcement, Intel was on a rally. What if that had continued? To date, that may have possibly meant 100/share, though it's hard to tell if inflation would have affected this. The price then was about 50 bucks, which is where I bought in. Even if I'm wrong, I should at least be able to get my money back, though, again, I won't be making that decision for years until the miracle announcement comes for the security improvement (or doesn't after 10 or so years).

It's also possible that more damaging flaws will be discovered (actually, that's probably guaranteed), and/or big consumers like Microsoft Azure will start to lose confidence and start replacing Intel with AMD. I don't see the former being too impactful. I mean, meltdown and spectre are hard to beat. The latter I'm not worried about either because, as is the case with Microsoft, what's the real benefit of moving to AMD at this point? That would be a whole lot of hardware to replace, and for what? Though AMD isn't particularly impacted by the newer spectre attacks, it is still certainly impacted by these ""type"" of flaws, and again, susceptible to future flaws and loss in customer faith (for performance). So, it would be a risky and huge bet which I don't think Microsoft (for example) will make.

Based on these reasons, I think Intel is a good long-term play. Now's the time to buy, and cross your fingers that the major market correction to come doesn't impact Intel ""too much"", or you may be waiting decades to get your money back.

129,AI, I feel like every major hedge fund uses AI or some sort of model that now investing based on intuition and potential of a company can find bigger returns.

The words are there but the logic isn't.  

Anyways, none of that is why I hate it.  I hate it because  it is self reinforcing.   The more people agree that it works, the more it works.  So for that reason I still have to learn this ridiculous Pokémon stats.",Hellkyte,2,/r/investing/comments/nnjenv/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gzwfajp/,0.206,0.717,0.077,-0.9386
131,MSCI," Hey, I am a beginner wanting to invest in the iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF (NASDAQ:ESGU). I'm in Canada so I would prefer to purchase iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA Index ETF (TSX:XSUS), so I don't need to pay the currency exchange fee. The two funds appear to follow the same index and have only a few 0.1% differences in holdings. One major difference I did find is that the XSUS has changed it's holdings significantly in the past month.

They follow the same index so shouldn't the holdings not be that different between the two?

For some reason, ESGU has about doubled XSUS in gains in the past 6m and 1y. How could it be such a large difference? Am I missing something here?

136,OR," Need some help update my portfolio due to a roth rollover i did (had to sell some stuff so need to reinvest). I am mid 30s and my 401k is pretty well rounded. For my Roth, below, is my current/projected breakdown (still need to invest the extra money).  
  
I would love some input! I am medium to slightly high risk taker. Thanks!  
  
I am thinking:  
  
VTI - 48%  
  
VO - 5% mid cap  
  
ARKK - 5% - small stuff (or is ARKG better?)  
  
WCLD - 5% cloud stuff  
  
VXUS - 20% -international tencent taking over the world....  
  
ICLN/TAN - 10%  
  
SEAH - SPAC 2%  
  
Stocks - 5% (mostly disney) <-currently holding

&#x200B;

Should I :  
1. replace WCLD with ARKW - seems both are very similar abut ARKW has 2 more years in performance over WCLD  
2. Reduce VXUS by 5-10% and include ARKF and ARKG? I think ARKK covers all the specific ARK stocks so I could raise ARKK a bit OR add other specific ARKS to the table and reduce VXUS? 

Any tips?",shaselai,1,/r/investing/comments/nnjdzh/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gzv9dhh/,0.011,0.888,0.101,0.9415
