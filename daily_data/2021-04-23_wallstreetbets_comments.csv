I‚Äôve been learning I need to take profits when I have them, especially when it‚Äôs already guaranteed. However, MVIS could really scream higher still from here, depending on some the of PR news we are hoping for next week along with earnings. Could also really take off if they get bought out soon like a lot of people including me think they will. However, today was likely the majority of the short squeeze so you did probably miss that part of it. But I never really even bought in for the short squeeze potential anyways, it just sort of happened. TL/DR, you likely missed the short squeeze, but could still have money on the table due to the other reasons like PR announcements on their sample A lidar and potential buying for much higher than current share price of it happens.

180,DD," Opinions of other people can be read, but I don't think they are worth anything. 

DD isn't something you get from someone else, unless you paid them and you trust them. DD is something you have to do. 

If you want to learn valuation, just start doing them. Pick 10 random companies you don't know, have someone remove the market cap from the materials for you and read everything. Do a discounted cash flow and put a number to it and compare it to current market value.

Or much simpler, try to evaluate how much you would be willing to pay for a random business in your town.

WSB is not a good place to learn about valuation. It's a good place to learn about options, but options are like crack.

188,AMC," RIDE has been solid lately. I have 10k shares of that currently which is about $100k so it works for this example perfectly. I don't worry about price. I focus on premium income. If it rises above my CC I still profit but don't worry as much about any lost upside unless I know a catalyst is in the near future. Currently I have $11 CCs because the borrowing rate is high and there are low available shares so it could run a bit but normally I do closer to the money. With that said at the current $21/weekly I do 100 covered calls. I will make $2100/week. Multiple by four and I make $8400 in a month off the covered calls. Since RIDE is near it's all time low, the downside risk is lower, but not gone. If it runs, I have a cost average right at $10 so I would also profit $1/share. I also do this with ROOT, UWMC, AMC, and a few others. Rarely do my covered calls get hit. Then after the price runs, I sell puts. In this example I would sell $10 puts... A price I wouldn't mind owning the shares at again. They pay $81 currently. I would buy 100 of them. That locks up my $100k for a week just like shares would. I then profit $8100 OR I end up with the shares again with a cost basis of $9.19. If the don't get executed I keep selling puts until I get the shares. That makes me potentially $32k in a month. So... My strategy is VERY doable with a real example that has played out nicely for a month. Will likely continue. When it stops, I move on.

190,OR," RIDE has been solid lately. I have 10k shares of that currently which is about $100k so it works for this example perfectly. I don't worry about price. I focus on premium income. If it rises above my CC I still profit but don't worry as much about any lost upside unless I know a catalyst is in the near future. Currently I have $11 CCs because the borrowing rate is high and there are low available shares so it could run a bit but normally I do closer to the money. With that said at the current $21/weekly I do 100 covered calls. I will make $2100/week. Multiple by four and I make $8400 in a month off the covered calls. Since RIDE is near it's all time low, the downside risk is lower, but not gone. If it runs, I have a cost average right at $10 so I would also profit $1/share. I also do this with ROOT, UWMC, AMC, and a few others. Rarely do my covered calls get hit. Then after the price runs, I sell puts. In this example I would sell $10 puts... A price I wouldn't mind owning the shares at again. They pay $81 currently. I would buy 100 of them. That locks up my $100k for a week just like shares would.

Looking at the Lidar field overall we see that Luminar is currently in the lead with a Market Cap of 6.5B. If MVIS Lidar meets expectations(which we have seen no indication otherwise). Then I would expect this to push us a lot closer to or over Luminar Market cap. PPS target about $42. So even if it falls short off of initial news we should be in $35 range. once any announcements of deals come out then I would expect the rise to continue.

Besides this there are other Verticles to consider. NED (near eye display) Engine used in Microsofts Hololense 2 is MVIS tech which we receive royalties from. The NED contract does not have exclusivity and could see others utilizing our tech. (speculated that upcoming Niantic VR glasses use our NED).

298,MSFT," So assuming that Luminar is not overvalued, not only would the tech have to beat Luminar, but they also have to take market share from Luminar. That is a combination of tech superiority and cost. They've actually been touting their ""Best in Class"" LIDAR for a while, but it hasn't translated to sales.

300,RKT," My biggest gripe is that they give the loans to too many LMI (low income lenders) with a higher default rate.

One of their main business models is refinancing. So loang to pay off your loan. 

Im not saying its 08 lol but Im saying RKT will get affected badly by the current interest rate and inflation issues, even more so than other mortgage lenders 


but its just a theory, it can be false, if you believe it to be false then by all means invest.

350,DD," This is not Cannabis 2.0. MindMed and the shroom industry are a biotech play. What matters is Intellectual Property. There is no money in just producing shrooms or lsd. Anyone can do it...like cannabis...that's why it crashed.

What is needed is something to monetize like: 1) Patent a molecule or drug derived from psilo or lsd. 2) FDA trials and approvals 3) Proprietary processes or drug delivery forms.

MindMed's 18-MC trial is a good example. Patent a molecule to replace Ibogaine. Start trials on drug addiction. Get FDA approval then go to the moon (insert rockets). Project Lucy uses lsd but is a proprietary process.

J&J makes a shit ton of money on their depression drug Spravato, which is esketamine...a patented ketamine derivative and put it in a nasal spray. Each dose is hundreds of $$ instead of generic ketamine pricing. That's what we want.

I guess my point is don't look at this as a cannabis play or worry about how hard it is to grow shrooms. Look at the shroom companies like pharmas, do your DD, and decide if you want to jump in.

so, there remains a \*thriving\* black market. as if it was difficult to get a medical card anyhow (and avoid the taxes), just pull up weedmaps and it's easy to find an ""illegal"" dispensary, no ID, no medical card, no taxes.

386,MA," I am not well-versed in technical analysis, so apologies if these questions are stupid.  First, how do you account for the fact that the S&P500 both changes composition and is also not a randomly selected sample?  Whatever is observed is, by definition, not cycles that exist in a given selection of securities, but in different securities packaged based upon factors which would absolutely be expected to be strongly correllated with the observations you're trying to make.

Once that is accounted for, presuming it is, how do you factor in the fact that this is a market whose largest participants are very likely to be causing exactly the movements being observed, observing these movements, and responding to them, causing further movements, and both the visibility, the movements possible (or just plausible), and other factors have changed dramatically over the time periods being examined?  (Think moving from physical ticker tapes to nearly instantaneous price numbers, are the patterns very clearly simply scaled to shorter timeframe given that the reactions must necessarily be?)

>The same chart as in the Fibo example, but here the 150 MA is applied; as it can be seen, the correction bounces off it

And if you doubled the width of the time period?  You can trivially make it look like a moving average is 'bouncing off' a correct by just picking your time period, especially if you're not even centering the period around the inflection point.  How was the time period chosen?  What does it look like if you take the 150 data points with 75 on each side of that 'bounce'?  Does it still look like a bounce?

Also, if you roll back the exact same methodology, say, 50 years, and move forward with it, how accurate is it?  What would your analysis have said 6 months ago?",otakucode,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider/gvj5nch/,0.007,0.917,0.075,0.9645

They were selling blue drinks there were straight alcohol and there were high school kids throwing up in the corners with blue tongues. Yachty came out looking like Gordons fisherman in those yellow fishing overalls. I was on two tabs and it was pretty magical watching everyone party to some lullaby trap.

When Migos were about to come on, the crowd got crazy. Beautiful expensive women came out of the woodwork. All ass and tits and lips. Then they started making gunshot noises and the cops showed up and kicked everyone out. Spent the rest of the night on the docks in LI city watching Manhattan breathe in the distance tripping balls. We ran into a little spanish street party, with music and food, right near the water. I can still remember the smell of the carnitas hitting. You rarely get hungry tripping but that shit got me straight aroused.

467,MVIS," In case you were unaware, MVIS has been for sale for quite a while. One of the members of MVIS's Board of Directors (Judy Curran) was just in a meeting called the Ricardo Mobility Summit 2021 regarding the Digitization of Product Development.  

Attending were the following people from several companies:

- John Bogema (Ford)
- Marc LaPlante (Ricardo Software)
- Przemek Tomczak (Senior VP of KX and First Derivatives)
- Tara Prakriya (General Manager for Edge Platforms, Microsoft)
- Mike Gery (Director of Advanced R&D, PACCAR)

They spoke about being very enthused with what progress they've seen so far, and several companies are rumored to want to buy out MVIS, with the latest estimate I've seen be at $108/share.

The following companies I've seen rumored to express interest

- Ford/Google Deal
- Apple Deal
- Microsoft Deal (Due to HoloLens 2)
- Tesla Deal (Though to be fair, not likely due to Elon being Elon)

Lidar A Sample was supposed to be promised in April timeframe, and the original Q1 results were meant to be announced in May, but have now been moved forward to April 29th. Which means the Lidar announcement will likely be announced then in next Thursday's after hours. Optimistically speaking, I expect this to shoot share price in around the $27/share region, as the rise to $24/share was just showing that they were on target.

The past few quarters they have announced rockstar earnings blowing way past expectations by huge margins and every single time the share price takes a bit hit in response.

567,AMD," **The Bull**

INTC P/E is 12.8, market cap $260B

AMD P/E is 40.6, market cap $99B

If we were to value INTC the same as we do AMD, it's market cap would be $824B

If we do the inverse on AMD, it's market cap would be $31B

INTC is undervalued, because it's PE is low by any measure. A PE of 12.8 is less than most boomer stonks. The reason it's so low is because there is growing concern that it will continue to lose market share.

AMDs PE is also undervalued. A PE of 40 is about right for any tech stonk, it's literally an exact match to MSFTs P/E.

But why is it undervalued? Because AMD has lots of room to grow. It's growth can easily keep up with it's current valuation. Every earnings report is a massive double digit growth in every business segment. And every time it's stonk trades flat, or even dips a % or two after earnings. 

Why? because it's priced in. At a ~40 P/E, it's expected that AMD will keep growing. So double digit growth is no surprise.

**Now let's look at the LONG bear..**

Both are over-valued. Yep, even with INTC at 12 P/E and AMD at 39 P/E, there is a long term bear care


**The 200 IQ move**

ARM is moving into desktop & server space. Which means the ever growing x86 market is going stale.

The Toyota Corolla is the best selling most reliable vehicle on the plant. Toyota will never sacrifice quality and reliability for cheap gimmicks. The Corolla features are always several years behind other models/makes. This is because Toyota will only allow fully vetted and proven products in their cash cow.

Next generation Corolla will feature a fake display in the rearview mirror. When this happens, you will regret not getting in on my retard play.

But why is it undervalued? Because AMD has lots of room to grow. It's growth can easily keep up with it's current valuation. Every earnings report is a massive double digit growth in every business segment. And every time it's stonk trades flat, or even dips a % or two after earnings. 

Why? because it's priced in. At a ~40 P/E, it's expected that AMD will keep growing. So double digit growth is no surprise.

Getting off 14nm isn't really benefiting them in any substantial way other than investor facesaving. Their current 10nm chips are mostly just... bad. 

Their fabs at this point are a liability, not an asset. IBM had to PAY global foundries $1.5b to take their fabs on when they were in Intel's current position of behind behind the curve, and there's no sign of Intel being ahead of the curve for years to come at least.

>TSM already can't supply AMD enough chips. AMD has no way to solve this

That's just not even necessarily true. AMD's projecting 37% revenue increases this year, and AMD's due to switch to 5nm for some of its processors this year according to its own roadmap (likely EPYC), which will free up 7nm capacity for desktop/laptop production, on top of AMD increasing their wafer buys. You're just not paying attention. AMD's been choosing to not increase production, if it fits with their plans they can.

Their fabs at this point are a liability, not an asset. IBM had to PAY global foundries $1.5b to take their fabs on when they were in Intel's current position of behind behind the curve, and there's no sign of Intel being ahead of the curve for years to come at least.

>TSM already can't supply AMD enough chips. AMD has no way to solve this

That's just not even necessarily true. AMD's projecting 37% revenue increases this year, and AMD's due to switch to 5nm for some of its processors this year according to its own roadmap (likely EPYC), which will free up 7nm capacity for desktop/laptop production, on top of AMD increasing their wafer buys. You're just not paying attention. AMD's been choosing to not increase production, if it fits with their plans they can.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BB.TO/balance-sheet/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BB.TO/balance-sheet/)

Non-current assets (things like patents) are valued by BB at $1.8bn. Even assuming a 50% purchasing premium all non-current assets (which won't only be patents) are valued at like $2.7bn. And a 50% premium is not likely.

Why the hell wouldn't whoever is buying the ""$12-15bn"" patent portfolio **just buy the company** considering market cap is $4.8bn and that would buy **everything** BB has?

And Motorola sold 17k patents + 7500 applications, not 7500, Kodak isn't a comparable company (how are image processing patents similar to BBs patent portfolio?) You've not provided any source for Nokia's patent value but considering they're likely patents in 5G infrastructure they're going to be valued high and AOL sold patents for things like online advertising which would obviously attract high values - and isn't something BB deals in.

Not to mention you're just so far off on everything else too, Blackberry Spark is no revolutionary piece of software. Microsoft, VMware, IBM all have better UEM products.

Patents are largely being sold off, so I don't really see how they're relevant either.

Because the last 4 years were in direct correlation to unfettered cyber attacks, misinformation campaigns, and stripping and deregulating securities.

Patents are being sold off, have we even heard for how much yet?  I imagine when whales like FB buy it they pay big moneys.  And if some whales are found to have infringed upon patents when developing their platforms, I'd think restitutions might be in order, and I think there are these cases.

896,NKLA," Going to reverse WSB on this. NKLA is a smart play at $10 if you're willing to hold it for more than two years.

Cons: 

* They have no real tech
* Their ex-CEO/founder/largest shareholder is a complete scumbag
* They rolled a truck downhill a few year ago.

Pros:

* They're the only company in the US with working prototypes for hydrogen powered long haul trucks
* They have a deal to buy electricity for 2.5c kwh in Arizona to turn into fuel
* They're almost done constructing their massive factory, and some nerd films the construction every day on Youtube.
* This fueling station deal thing in the news now.

This stock has been beaten to shit and it's a SPAC still worth over $4B. Might sink lower, but I've thrown away $10k on dumber bets.

The reality is that SKLZ doesn't have a 95% profit margin.

Honestly, exit GME.

There is only 22% short on it (a 7th of its high when it mooned) you've netted a 69% (noice) gains and it's your bulkiest holding 

Drop the meme buy and diversify, GME is not a long hold, intrinsically it is a deflating balloon as on paper it is not worth the $90 you bought in at. It is very very unlikely that it will shoot back up, it doesn't pay a meaningful dividend (1% which is going to get slashed even lower since they can't afford that as the stock price does not reflect the value of the company), that money is just sitting there unrealised. Capitalise on it or at least realise a portion of it via covered calls and collect premiums

The US will be hitting this out of the park, meaning that even with a population reaching herd immunity/a majority of citizens vaccinated, they will choose to stockpile vaccines. Covaxin has a better shelf life and better storage conditions that the mRna vaccines.

This is conjecture, but couldn't Ocugen be tapped to help supply this part of the world with vaccines in the future? They won't just be a distributor but also a manufacturer.

In the short term, they're not making money operating locations at 60% capacity and their debt literally piles up monthly; there is no end in sight. Even worse, business was on the decline for the last 4 years, the pandemic didn't put AMC in this position so reopening and resuming business as usual isn't enough to recover from this. The best way to fundraise(to handle the growing debt issue) is to sell more shares at it's current overinflated price(again), which is why they are voting to do exactly that.
