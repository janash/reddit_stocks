0,DD," Just FYI, analysts are usually as wrong as anyone else. I've seen analysts establish a price target that didn't get hit until years later, if at all.

When you read something and immediately believe it because it ""sounds credible"" then it's a lie and you're being an idiot. I can also clue you in to the fact that just about every DD post that's shown up here in the last year is bullshit and half-assed at best. If the information is curated to convince you to ""buy now"" then it's not DD.

Everyone that consistently sees gains in the market has 10's years of experience over you, you can't even comprehend how behind you are if you started trading just last year. All the gains porn you've all seen is 100% either lucky people or posted to deceive and exploit the community.

Day traders are self-interested and don't care about you, no matter what they say or how convincing they are. Investors don't post on forums all that much, they want to buy low and they don't care if the price is low, they're in it for the long haul and not trying to convince you to buy in to anything. Learn to spot people's intentions by what they say and not what they claim to be.

If someone tells you they're not a salesmen and begins to try and sell you something, they're a damn salesmen.

And analysts are ultimately just one of numerous types of salesmen in the industry. If you can't independently figure out why the company might be worth $7 per share *and by when* then your just gambling and this is just a sales pitch.

The stock market is hard because it takes a lot of work, and most people don't want to do a lot of work.",sneakattack,6,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lzt2v2/stay_the_course/gq4jyg0/,0.091,0.821,0.088,-0.4978

Seriously considering throwing cash down for max leverage through at least 22’. It doesn’t have to go up much AT ALL to make a decent (2x+) ROI, and I really think even if the company doesn’t grow, it will still pass 2$ before the year is out due to it being a dollar weed stock.

It is worth it to note that SNDL sucks ass as a company. BUT it may be profitable this year and I do believe it will pass 2$.

53,TA," I don’t pump stocks. Look at my posts. I find DD’s on here and if the DD looks good to me ill do some furthers analysis on it and post my findings here. If I was trying to pump stocks i would be focused on one stock and active in many communities trying to pump that stock. Many people do that which is why ppl should look at the account who’s posting the stock. 

As for losing money, I’m sorry. I’ve lost money before too which is why I do some TA to help me find the better time to buy than from a simple FA on here. 

Confidence in a company is what causes people to post on this community. If they were confident and didn’t post that would destroy the purpose of the community.
