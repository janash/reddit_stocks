0,CTXR, I’m just mad that I averaged down on CTXR when it was in the 1.70s. If I had waited another week or something I could’ve gotten it at the 1.50s and been up a lot.

So, you do tons of research on companies, take a risk with your money, get smacked by an occasional loss on a company that misfires and then when you hit a winner, they want to take 42% of the gain.  I think I am done for awhile except for very small positions in AGTC, CTXR and OBSV.
