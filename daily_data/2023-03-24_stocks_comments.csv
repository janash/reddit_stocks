0,OP," Still reading, but at least the things in the OP are a little bit weird.

> Unrealized losses aren’t reflected on banks’ balance sheets due to an accounting practice where assets are held on banks’ books at the value at which they are bought, instead of their current market value.

This depends on the type of asset. HTM assets don't use the current market value because you aren't planning on selling them for their market value, you're planning on keeping them until they mature. Using their market value can be even more misleading as it doesn't take into account the value of the owner's intent with the asset.

It's like the bond version of somebody who fully owns their primary residence. If the value of your residence drops, does it actually affect you? If you need liquid cash, maybe. If you don't need liquid cash or aren't planning on moving, your primary residence's value is more important as a house than the monetary value of the house. It's the same here. the bonds will always be worth at least their final value defaults aside. It's the time value of the money and the liquidity of those assets that changes before the term of the debt is reached.

AFS securities are the opposite. Bonds you intend to sell instead of holding onto.

The issues highlighted in this article directly relate to problems with the idea of fractional reserve baking and liquidity of the banks. In reference to the article, in some cases it’s actually more misleading to value and asset at it’s current price compared to the price you bought it at.

11,OP," What I’m talking about is the consequences that the article and OP articulates about GAAP are exactly the same as the consequences of fractional reserve banking. Runs on the bank have always been an issue. Too many depositors take out their deposits at the same time, then it’s bad period. That obviously exists to varying degrees depending on risk management at the bank, but it’s always been true. GAAP and fractional reserve banking aren’t the issue. Financial risk management is. But every retail investor seems to be running around like headless chickens atm and everyone who works in finance are calm as cucumbers as it’s well established knowledge. 

My overall point is if you understood fractional reserve banking before, which I would assume most people in this sub were aware of, then this article and OP aren’t presenting a new risk. They’re merely critiquing GAAP which many smarter people than them have spent decades trying to perfect. Nothing shady going on at all.

12,III, Ultimately it's inconsequential for large banks subject to Basel III because unrealized losses on bonds are still accounted for when calculating liquidity but not for accounting. It just makes accounting easier and it's not like these unrealized losses are hidden from sight where banks are actually completely insolvent but hiding it. Should also be noted no other bank in America had the same asset mix as SVB and the aggregate 1.5 trillion in unrealized losses is spread throughout the entire banking system.,NEWSmodsareTwats,1,/r/stocks/comments/120fb6f/fortune_us_banks_are_sitting_on_17_trillion_in/jdj5exz/,0.179,0.751,0.071,-0.8645

I dont know I guess it depends on what the test itself is built for. Isn't it more like 9 months stacked on top of some of the fastest rate increases that we have seen in forever across the world banks? Its not exactly a light situation we have here.

I don't think these kinds of trial/tests can ever be 100% foolproof; but if I ask myself whether I think CS would have lasted this long without these tests being in place?

But he is a devout leftist and his parents are, and as I understand it, basically all of those who run the organization are leftists. It seems to me that they think they can solve all huge financial problems in the USA by simply printing more money and just continuously running up the national debt. In this case, I think the inevitable answer sometime will end up metaphorically being breaking 300 eggs to make a 3 egg omelet. The people who have their money in the failing banks should obviously get it back in check form from the federal government. But the “too big to fail” banks should be allowed to fail. Knowing they can make super-risky investments and always be bailed out is a vicious, dangerous cycle. Just print the money to pay the people who have their money in them, then let them fail.

Imagine a ‘flash mob’ (technology re-applied; remember those? :^o) suddenly focused, moving all of their account balances away from a bank, nearly simultaneously… The stress-test scenarios are based on deposits on-hand at the snapshot time when the stress-test calculations are applied (amount of deposits on-hand, calculated against interest rates suddenly and significantly increasing). If the deposits drop -while- rates increase, that’s not part of the ‘stress-test’ measurement/calculations.

29,USA," Culture war BS is bad for your health and your critical thinking. You really need to revisit why you think Islam is some sort of special threat. Or that “black-on-black crime” is somehow inherently different than other types of crime.

American discourse conflates liberalism with leftism because there is effectively no left political party. Liberalism is in fact a center or center-right ideology and is considered as such in most of the world outside the USA.

Liberals and conservatives disagree about government roles in legislating morality and in the US and are currently in opposition about wedge issues like abortion, gay marriage and gun control. 

They are aligned on supporting US military hegemony and interventions in other countries (Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Somalia) Dems put on a show of opposing US presence in Iraq/Afghanistan only when they thought it would get them elected during the Bush years, but once Obama was in they stopped caring.

Liberals and Conservatives both believe in supply side economics, and generally understand the government’s role in the economy to be by engaging with Capital by offering tax incentives, cutting or tightening regulations, and implementing government policy by providing funding to private entities to execute. In this way the resources of society are fundamentally controlled by the few people/corporations that own the majority of them, who then lobby politicians to do what is in their interests. You will note that although there are some special interests who are only favored by one political party (e.g. Planned Parenthood, or the NRA) this is not the case for the defense industry, pharmacy companies, the financial industry, or the oil industry, just to name a few. These industries massively fund all politicians and we see the result. Joe Biden campaigned on curtailing new oil development, but nevertheless just approved a MASSIVE new lease in Alaska. 

Leftists fundamentally believe that resources should be allocated democratically rather than letting a few people accrue the majority of the benefits. Leftism opposes racism, sexism, etc. because such concepts are seen to be tools to divide people artificially. Leftism opposes aggressive war and interventions because they wreak havoc on societies for the benefit of the established moneyed interests at the expense of the poor. 

Leftist distinguish between personal property and private property. A person owns their home, car, tools, etc. as personal property. The concept of an individual (or corporation) owning hundreds of dwellings, a factory, a port, or exclusive mineral rights is private property and leftists seek to reduce that system of rent seeking behaviors whereby those who own those things collect large amounts of money without providing any added economic benefit. 

Implementing public ownership of privately held property is challenging for obvious reasons. Contrast this with how easily public property has become private. Someone who owns a 10,000 acre ranch in Texas owns it because at some point when it was public property a previous owner bought the rights to use it from the government (and it came to be government owned by either war or threat of violence). 

I don’t really identify as a leftist. I say I am a Progressive Republican just to piss people off. 

Anyway, back to stocks, if we actually had a leftist political establishment, we should expect banks to not be bailed out but rather to be nationalized or dissolved.

Similar to WBA/CVS, Petco trying to adapt to changes by moving towards services - ""Petco: We are ‘becoming a services business,’ CEO says""  https://finance.yahoo.com/video/petco-becoming-services-business-ceo-150603247.html. 

WBA has been a ""can't win"" for years now. Peaked in 2015, too many stores, is down 62% since. Covid wasn't the beneficiary people thought it would be and the stock keeps heading lower. I haven't liked the business for years but at around book value with a good newer CEO, one feels like it's a little overhated. 

WBA isn't going to the moon (or probably anything remotely close) any time soon and neither is WOOF, but trading at around book (WOOF is at about book value) feels a little overhated for something that is not an exciting business at all but probably isn't going away any time soon. 

I don't own either.",dvdmovie1,4,/r/stocks/comments/1207yws/petco_001_eps_miss_20_decline_opportunity/jdh1ddm/,0.084,0.856,0.06,-0.7335
38,IMO," I think we are in, how do you say, a bubble but a bubble with many smaller bubbles within in it. Sort of like a large bubble encasing many smaller ones. Anyone of these bubbles popping could cause a contagion effect. What is concerning is the fact this economy has been injected with cash from the actions due to the pandemic. Was injecting cash a good thing? Eh, hindsight is 20/20..am I right? Rhetorical of course, we simply don’t 100% know. I do know many folks and businesses alike are using these funds, wages and savings to push up the market all while collecting money from these investments. Might be an explanation to where some of the missing work force went. It’s very interesting using analytics and techniques to review market data but it’s human behavior at the core. Right now everyone who has skin in the game are at best trying to find what will pop first. With so much fear and confusion it’s like the fed thinks we need something familiar to happen in the market to know which way is up. IMO not gonna happen. This inflation is going to stick. Why? Too much money chasing too few goods. Slap the working force and unemployment goes up. Thing is, I don’t think it’s the working class with the money. So I see high unemployment and moderate inflation 4-5%, but a big demand in growth for services. So I’ll call it Flowflation. Ew, how do we get out of this? Policy to detach from energy costs and dare I say it drop interest rates and some how get the rich closer to us in terms of income. I’m also skeptical that something is lurking in the shadows of some heavy weight countries.

42,AI, I think with the massive amount of liquidity pumped into the economy in 2020 and recently with the bank bailouts is by definition responsible for majority of the inflation. I think the significance of AI truly cannot be discounted either and will turn our economy on its head in the near future through hyperinflation imo.

45,IMO," Here are my signs:

1) Interest rates are higher than dividend return rates. Interest rates are less riskier than dividends, meaning the market is irrational.

2) People don't look valuations anymore. If you use a rule of thumb where PE indicates the future growth rate then things are completely out of whack. There is not PE to actual growth equality.

3) Analysts take down the expectations meaning ""downgrade"" so that it is a very low bar to beat expectations. When expectations are beaten then all is awesome. What makes this worse is the fact that company are twisting their balance sheets using financial engineering like share buybacks.  Apple is a great example of this. 

What I want to see is companies investing in really new tech new ideas. There was a paper that wrote true invention is dying when you look at patents issued. People are just rehashing old territory. 

Here is IMO an example of really interesting tech: Segway. It failed more or less, but the technology is awesome.

Oil investors were initially a bit disappointed by the administration indefinitely putting off SPR purchases (even though the entire futures curve going years ahead is below their target price... come on people). Drilling rigs in the US increased but barely:

> The total rig count rose to 758 this week—88 rigs higher than the rig count this time in 2022 and 317 rigs lower than the rig count at the beginning of 2019, prior to the pandemic

But, and correct me if I'm wrong, more bullish news is that frac spreads rose significantly. In other words, more drilling crews 'completed' the work on drilled but not-completed wells. This means more oil can come online in the immediate future, but on a slightly longer time scale, means the DUC (drilled but uncompleted) well inventory decreases.

91,EFC," i usually an advocate but even i am getting weary eyed from them. Remote work is devastating commercial, and high interest is hurting residential. The quandary is that REITs already own the majority of there assets. The book value on a lot of high yield ones are getting ridiculously high. example, EFC book value is 15.12$ and its trading at 11.25$, a book value of 1.34. Where as a good book value is anything 1.0 and above. Most off them can still pay there debts fairly well, dividend included, and have assets that exceed there stock value. Its an odd time fore REITs, my best guess is if you look for specific types you can find good ones, probably should avoid MREITs right now at the very least.",esqualatch12,2,/r/stocks/comments/120f32f/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_mar/jdia5iq/,0.136,0.625,0.239,0.9528

153,OP," The suggestion to pretend/simulate the first time is a good one.  Even the first few times.

What I found the first few times I tried options trading was that *even if I was right in the long term*, I almost always underestimated how long it would take for whatever I thought would happen to occur.  Playing pretend at first would have taught me that lesson without it costing me real money.

Ultimately I personally stopped options trading entirely because I realized that it really is as close to gambling as the stock market gets, and I was hooked on that gambling.  OP, please be careful of this.  You might not be walking into a casino, but the high (and the risks!) are similar - or potentially even worse.  Know that using options to try and get a payday off of your market movement theory is NOT investing, it is speculation and gambling.

155,USA," This is a fantastic plan. Would recommend setting up an emergency fund and possibly small bond portfolio.

But 12-15% is unrealistic imo unless you're willing to accept a ton of volatility. Except 6-9% with a safer volatility.

Its better to have lower volatility and lower returns than a higher volatility and higher returns. Mainly because on the off chance you have to sell (buy a house, parents get ill, children need tuition money, anything unexpected, etc) it will be at a downturn. Thats usually more costly.

But investing is very personal, and this is from a USA perspective. I only have one friend who's dad made 300k a year in the middle east with no taxes and he gifted her a 500k wedding.

161,AI," Almost zero. The risk is more with cyber attacks.

The finance sector has always been heavy users of AI. I think we've already seen the use AI change the nature of the market noticeably over the last few decades.

Retail investors might start using AI more but won't move the market much compared to the big boys who are already using AI with much more sophistication than any retail investor will be able to achieve on their own and with limited resources.

It's also worth remembering that no AI is going to be able to tell you if TSLA is going to create a successful EV company back in 2010.

It's also not going to be able to tell you the health of the US economy in 10 years. If you make long bets on companies you believe in or just stick with long-term index investing then none of this matters anyway.",kriptonicx,6,/r/stocks/comments/120blon/what_are_the_chances_that_an_ai_computer_model/jdh4hrs/,0.046,0.887,0.067,0.6846

169,AI," Buy Nvidia, always hold for 5+ years. As long as AI continues to grasp humanity, Nvidia will continue to grow at a rapid pace. Way above other companies. People think it's overvalued but truth is, Nvidia's growth will be massive and the stock will continue to rise.

Buy Meta. Zuckerberg is on the ball right now. His massive cuts will be huge and will easily guide Meta through this recession and Meta will continue to dominate, especially when it has basically no competition with TikTok being banned. (It will be banned, politicians are too afraid of China using it to influence voters, aka their jobs, let alone all the security risks) Meta actually doesn't need as many employees as other companies, (copying Twitter and Musk basically), and the number of cuts being made were huge.

You could buy bank stocks if you know you'll hold for 5+ years. They might be stagnant for a few months or even a couple years worst case scenario, but they should do well eventually. Now is a good spot to buy in when everyone else have fear of the banks. Many are close to 52 week lows.
