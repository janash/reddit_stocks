We were tinkering with a project at MasterCard years ago that would allow assets to be held in investments (we were using actual shares of stock but what it became will be backed by cryptocurrency now) that could be liquidated in a predefined way ('sell these $MSFT shares first if required') at NBO to complete a transaction.

The best we could come up with to make it backed by actual shares of equity would be to use Apex. ...which is what Robinhood was still using at the time. We never got beyond email back and forth with Apex but they had silly order volume requests [edit: in lieu to cash which as an internal 'toy' project at the time wouldn't be possible] which we couldn't promise because our little plan relied on cardholder's spending habits and other bits that we hadn't even begun to consider and cannot be well predicted.

3,API," Seriously, the most unfortunate result of the last few weeks is the supposed exodus from Robinhood to other firms. That's fine in the short term... it feels good to say you're sticking it to the man or whatever but with RH on their heels like this, it's the absolute perfect time for their entire user base to get together and demand deep, meaningful changes in the way Robinhood does business. And like dropping commissions, at some point, other firms would eventually need to follow suit. This was an opportunity to impact how the financial industry operates all the way down to how brokerages and clearinghouses are structured internally without waiting for regulators to do it wrong again and possibly create new barriers for small, retail traders.

11,TDA," I haven't seen an organized effort to get that or any of the things I listed done. Demanding it on your own is dandy but you're a single voice in ten million accounts just like my wishlist is just one in ten million.

I know a lot of people feel sending an angry email to support or closing their account feels like a boycott that'll punish Robinhood but a successful boycott needs clear goals that will impact reputation if unmet. You cannot go after their pocket by closing your account because there's still enough account holders to stay afloat and enough private equity backing them. But a year from now, when asked ""What do you guys think about Robinhood?,"" being able to point directly to a list of unmet demands will impact their reputation more than one star reviews on Google Play ever will. More than randomly posting ""fuck Robinhood"" ever will. It's likely in your best interest to move your assets away but that shouldn't be the end. Until early this month, not even Robinhood had a solid reason to bow to customer demands to *prevent* damage to their reputation. Now is/was the time.

Ignoring all of Vlad's inane bullshit and Robinhood's horrible attempts at making things look normal, it came down to the DTCC telling Robinhood and other firms to pay money they didn't yet have. The decision to limit trading was up to firms and most of them decided that's what they'd do **because they're allowed to regardless of how it impacts customers** which without a doubt is in line with policies at the firms you're leaving for. Webull, IB, TDA, Schwab, etc. all modified trading that day and/or the days that followed in various ways (outright stopped trading $GME without trading halts at the exchanges down to just making it non-marginable at Schwab). They were all *allowed* to do it and will do so again if similar circumstances arise because the law will always be on their side in this and I haven't seen a statement from any firm stating they'll just go bankrupt overnight instead next time. But TDA doesn't need to listen to demands from retail traders with $5000 accounts. Chuck doesn't need to make promises to people who don't even know that the bid-ask spread is a thing. Webull has deep pockets backing it in China, so even with a ruined reputation, it's never going to have much of a financial reason to go above and beyond for customers either. But Robinhood trying to salvage their public image would *need* to seriously consider and respond to organized, basic, well-publicized (CNBC and the rest would eat this up) demands with well defined penalties (*then* we close our accounts) if those demands are unmet. They're the only one on that list that *needs* to agree to terms with their account holders negotiating en masse right now and likely ever. Without you assholes, Robinhood has no need to act any differently than any other firm. Everyone who's upset and could have valid demands based on their collective experience will just go away to those other firms large enough to ignore you without risk of bad press and the only people left on Robinhood will be those who don't care how they're treated and/or weren't at all impacted. Nothing will change in Robinhood or in the broader industry.

When Robinhood posted this: https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/2/1/a-letter-to-our-robinhood-community, I figured people would get organized and respond. People didn't. In that post, Robinhood tried to wrap this entire mess up in a neat little box with ""Robinhood has always sought to put you—our customers—first."" ...and the response from customers was incoherent. ""Not like that!"" would have even been a valid response... The only real consistent action I've seen so far has been to downvote the daily thread bot (why?) and give bad reviews in app stores. None of the news this month related to this is looking forward; that hearing tried to pass blame onto Dodd-Frank and T+2 but none of it focused on how firms 'understand' what putting customers first means. 'Putting customers first' is corporate speak and nobody will ever defeat that but the clear, simple statement ""Robinhood does not listen to their customers."" still has meaning to human beings and should have been the theme of our collective response. You feel you can't ""trust money with a brand like that"" but in their tone deaf corporate way, they seem to believe they were actually acting in your best interest! If Robinhood (or any other firm) wants to keep their customers, they need to listen to the priorities of those same customers. Robinhood imagined halting trades was in the best interest of customers and from what I've seen in articles about it, they might not have had time to put forth options to customers but they also didn't have any reason to ask themselves what would be best for actual customers or even plan ahead to address this.

Before this mess, Robinhood was trying to reach out to this community in a way I honestly haven't seen before... Took them almost two years to even accept an invitation to hold an AMA here. This is a part of their proposal (modified for markdown) from January 20th...

> There are two things we want to offer that could be beneficial to you and the members of r/RobinHood:
> 
> 1. Monthly AMAs with Robinhood Staff on /r/RobinHood 
> 2. Monthly check-in calls between our team and the mod team. During our syncs, we can share: 
>   - Opportunities to participate in product betas, where the r/Robinhood community can help shape Robinhood offerings and provide feedback on products that are being built. 
>   - Exclusive product news and updates which we can work together on how to get this information out to the community.

I was still [trying to find a few people who could represent this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/l43bsa/open_call_for_applications_rrobinhood_community/) when $GME happened. Not getting a group together was my fault and I've since hit pause on it because I don't think it's in anyone's best interest to represent Robinhood using their real name in public to join us for an AMA. We're just customers and still get threats in modmail so I can't imagine anyone who works for Robinhood would expose themselves like that. I'd love to find a way to still use this sub's collective weight to find out what that 2.a bulletpoint might mean... hopefully, my list would finally be seen by someone who can actually make real decisions but every time Vlad opens his mouth, I care a little less.

I'm losing interest in this comment too so my point is that as a group, we have the power to make changes. Individually, we do not. I also had something about Chick-fil-A not caring that gay people don't like them... I think that was back when I was talking about being able to hit a company's revenue has almost no impact vs. their reputation.
