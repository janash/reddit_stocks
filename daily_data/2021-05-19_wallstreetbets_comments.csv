105,AMD," I believe the thinking behind it is:

-there is absolutely zero way for AMD to get more manufacturing capacity within the next two years. Every fab on the planet is pretty much maxed out. Companies and national governments are all investing hundreds of billions in new capacity, but that will take years to bear fruit.

-AMD will still sell every chip they make for 2 years, cashflow is no problem. 

-There is money you can spend on architecture R&D, like their cool chiplet shit. But AMD are already spending $1.5B there and that's already up 25% yoy, like how much more gasoline can you throw on that fire.

-AMD's stock has been losing value for absolute bullshit non-reasons and is at a buy-low point.

They are throwing cash into buybacks because they can't grow sales for any amount of money right now and their stock is legitimately undervalued. I would've looked into acquisitions with that $4B myself, but if you're low and tech is pretty high, I can see why you would bet on yourself.

Sold shares at these high prices? That has very little too do with making AMC a better company. He gave himself a pretty nice bonus for doing nothing earlier this year.

AMC ran with GME the first time and now GME is running with AMC now. I don't see this getting above 20 not matter how much ""data"" there is to support it. But, I was surprised it ran this high though so take that for what it is worth.

There are soooo many people involved in this movement that have zero knowledge about the stock market. Those will be shaken out by this weekend if AMC stays around $12. The ride ends before it even starts.

I wish we had someone with actual knowledge that could explain what is happening with the hedge funds. They don't have the same brokers/rules as retail. Are they really paying these prices?

174,AMC," ""We retailers helped save amc"" is 100% true. WE did. The CEO just got in front at the end and people are praising him for doing the only smart thing. AMC will forever be indebted to the people holding the stock and I hope they keep that in mind going forward. AMC wouldn't exist without the holders this spring.

I am taking numbers from MarketWatch:

Over the last 3 years (2017/18/19) the company costs about $4b each year to run (COGS). So, from the start, that is the bare minimum they need to handle each year. During those years they have been clearing over $5b which is good but they only made money once.

Now, what is very relevant (and might have changed) is that as of 2020 they have 616m in short term debt. They also have almost $800m in other liabilities. That puts them at 1.93b in total current liabilities. Next, their long term debt is almost $10b. When you look at the balance sheet they have $12b in total liabilities BEFORE COVID.

With all of these numbers, I am not certain what they have done recently. I have heard they refi'ed some stuff and put some of the recently raised money towards debt. But, I couldn't find anything to see what they have done. If it was a clear cut win I would think there would be some PR from AMC setting out how they are going to handle the debt.

I am not in AMC any more and I do wish you all the luck. I would like to see this turn into a blow up of the hedge funds and their lackeys in the SEC.",ehennis,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ng96co/maxed_out_my_margins_selling_naked_calls_on_amc/gyqa5va/,0.08,0.815,0.104,0.8087

The pandemic boosts, as well as what wages are available, plays a *much* larger role in whether people are in a rush to go back to work or not. If the unemployment rate is 6.1% now and it was 3.5% before the lockdown, we're already pretty close to normalizing. But after being stay-at-home parents for over a year, I'm not surprised working class people aren't in a rush to go back to their shitty jobs and then turn around and pay most of that for daycare.

283,GME," I don't think trading has to be inherently adversarial. 

However, some folks get really out of hand with abusing people to stay with their ""gang"" and hold through swings. The GME peak was crazy with people telling others that not holding was some kind of betrayal.

298,DD," Paying back a loan destroys money. Because the governments have funded through debt, or deficit spending, the debt needs to be serviced. Servicing a debt destroys money. Deficit spending pulls demand forward for current consumption at the cost of future consumption. Inflation will be transitory as the current consumption spiked considerably. Its how long it can stay transitory that is in question right now. Transitory could mean another 12months from now. Its absurd to think there isnt inflation right now. But how long it lasts is unclear. Theres a saying that you cant be a ‚Äòlittle bit‚Äô pregnant. One would argue that once inflation is here you cant put it back in the bottle.

The fiscal policy is what has changed from the GFC. Wage subsidies and unemployment and all the help for businesses was effectively helicopter drops of money. A lot of it doesnt need to be paid back, some of it is taxed, some of it not, all depends on the country/state/province etc. I myself cant say for sure but time will tell if the fiscal policy is enough to drive a sustained inflation year over year. 

Between debt and fiscal policy, im not sure which force will win. But lets just be clear, the fed is not ‚Äòprinting‚Äô money, its deficit spending. Deficit spending is inflationary AT FIRST. QE is not money printing, its not inflationary. 

Any policy changes or legal changes such as turning federal reserves into usable cash would be things to watch out for.

308,UK," yes lol. The government using debt is the same as anyone else. They must pay interest on it, or 'service' the debt. Im not certain that inflation is transitory, just the nature of deficit spending is transitory. Think about you getting a loan to buy a house. You are instantly granted 500k and buy a house with it. Now you pay it back slowly over time, plus interest. The interest stays in the system, the principal is effectively destroyed. You pulled demand forward to buy the house today, at the expense of putting a portion of income aside each month to pay it off; money that could have otherwise been used on other purchases.

We still are paying back debt from ww2. 

In terms of QE being inflationary, its been happening since the early 2000s in Japan, then the US, UK, EU, and now almost everyone and inflation didnt occur with those cases.

You know you can't do that, right? I don't report subreddits for brigading, but it's lame.

326,UWMC," UWMC is a SPAC, and the rules are pretty clear about SPACs. I don't understand what is vague.

Edit: I am so tired of hearing people argue that a SPAC isn't a SPAC anymore once the merger is complete. Read the first page of any 10K about the company's incorporation. In UWMC's case, it reads

>UWM Holdings Corporation, formerly known as Gores Holdings IV, Inc. (‚ÄúGores IV‚Äù), was originally incorporated in Delaware on June 12, 2019 as a special purpose acquisition company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses. On January 28, 2020, we consummated our initial public offering (the ‚ÄúIPO‚Äù), following which our shares began trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

That means it's a SPAC. Just like any other reverse merger, it doesn't cease being a reverse merge simply because the transaction is complete. The cap structure is even more fucked, and the float is even more jammed, than before the transaction. The rule exists because reverse mergers and SPACs are notorious for aggressive solicitation campaigns and very convoluted capital structures that the vast majority of its investor base don't understand because it doesn't populate on Yahoo Finance and other services correctly.",BeepBeepImaJeep3,-6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ngdffm/mods_we_need_to_have_a_discussion_about_your/gyqdlkr/,0.074,0.856,0.07,-0.258

329,CAN," I did when I first saw this thing being banded about, but then i read the FAQ on how they report it, and that soothed my worries.

""Where does IBorrowDesk get its data?

  
All IBorrowDesk data is sourced from Interactive Brokers. You can check the source .csv files here.

If it's in regards to the incomplete data sets regarding all shares borrowed by every broker, you're right in that I don't have that, but I CAN look at volume. And then i can make some calculations.

365,RIDE," Well...there is a problem.

Having spoken to ex employees( short lived employment), it is clear that the company is full of cheerleaders, technically incompetent and lazy individuals.

Aside, I m glad that this is an American company embarking on new technology.

The reality is that LM needs to work on building its core management and technical leadership.  They are at this point far from that level.

To excel in this market, you need smart and dedicated engineers, capable technicians and assembly workers and above average management.   Lacking this , the product ideas and implementation on all level-software, electrical, mechanical, manufacturing is impossible.  Products are not ready, income is missing and market reacts. Right now, LM cannot convince investors that they can deliver.

The fact is that many tickers beside RIDE lost  on its value in past 5 months.  There are too many companies on the market that produce nothing but promises, have zero sales and rely on stock price up-down cycles to make up income.

Too many retail investors ask what happened with their investments.   They ask why are their chosen picks losing value.  Well... Managements issued shares.  In 2020, many tickers had increase in share prices.  Lacking sales and contracts, managements in conjunction with brokerage and investment firms are now selling shares they issued which results in price downtrend.  As the prices recover, managements are buying shares back, just to sell shares at higher prices some time later.  Rinse and repeat-to pay for labor, supplies, services, etc.  Yes...managements who issued their own stocks are shorting (and longing) independently or in cooperation with large funds.

In a nutshell, the stock market is keeping all these 0 cars EV, make a promise pharma and other companies alive.  Who cares-it's the modern economy after all.  On the top of that add large investment firms who cycle the buy -sell activity as their profit appetite desires....  The equilibrium is somewhere in the middle, a resultant of desires and targets of all players-large and small.

If any investor or trader thinks that some entity is after his/her shares, it is most likely  that the founder and/or management of the very company an investor invested in is just manipulating as they please.",late2trade,-4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfonwv/ride_its_nowhere_near_over_yet/gyo1f8m/,0.057,0.811,0.132,0.9819

You truly have amazingly beautiful eyes that I haven‚Äôt seen

Shear winds rip through the hillsides upon the shore 

It‚Äôs hard to see the lighthouse out at sea through the night

417,DD," People are moving away from eating meat and drinking soda (which is made of corn). Factory farming is terrible for the soil, water table, the animals (they are also fed corn) and our diets. Look up how much water it takes to produce a pound of beef and you will reconsider beef consumption. Burger King has a beyond meat burger and I only see that becoming more commonplace. Ethanol was not the fossil fuel alternative the Bush administration said it would be. More EV , less fossil fuels. I see society moving away from a corn based economy and look to more sustainable alternatives heading into the future.

As for beyond meat... When u realize the saturated fat levels of those ""plant burgers"" are about as bad as movie theater popcorn (AMC represent) and literally cultured from embryonic cattle fetal tissue you may want to stop eating baby killing plant burgers and have the real thing. 95% of farms and farm land are carbon neutral RIGHT NOW! Not to mention those cow farts are a more sustainable source of energy (ready CNG production using methane gas from dairy farms) than the low to nothing value if grasses and even corn. Don't DD on me live life consider reading and learning something that college won't teach you.

Market is heavy and everyone can feel it. 
Fed and Bide admin will keep pouring fuel on the fire until they get far enough away from the election AND smash through tax changes that would face stiffer resistance if markets were declining. 
But the fear index is low IMO. We bounce back from everything after 1-3 down days.

420,ATH," The market is priced at ATH speculative values and is starting to wobble. Extremely risky time to be making plays.

If JPow and friends keep printing, that extra cash will have nowhere to go except into the stock market, and that will push it even higher from today. If they taper, this market will shed 20% faster than you can blink. I see a little upside, a ton of downside, and no easy way to predict which way the Fed will go. They will probably reach a decision by the end of summer, but as of right now, no one knows what they'll do. Even they don't know.

I'm stopping out below 33-34 but this thing will rocket with states starting to adopt online gambling and with sports starting back in full swing this fall.

This will jump to previous highs very quickly, 15B market cap, losing money to pay for advertisements but revenue expectation raised from 900M to 1.15B this year. 13 potential states opening up within the next 2 years to legalized gambling. International bettors hopefully get a piece of the action as well. It's only a matter of time. You'll be kicking yourself in 10 years when this, PENN and others are trading 5x from here.

Also I think the bottom is almost in for growth stocks, we have seen fear and capitulation take over the last 3 months as retail traders bleed themselves out. When you hear about people giving up that's the best time to get back in.

541,IMO," I support you Op (I own a position). I agree with your points and I disagree that wish is a scam. I admit there‚Äôs logistic improvements that can be made and better content/merchant screening and responsibility but it‚Äôs all part of growing pains. I‚Äôve ordered from them before and all but one time did I receive the wrong item. And besides who said you can‚Äôt find dildos on amazon or eBay, doesn‚Äôt make it a scam. 

But I think wish is misunderstood, especially since the founders are so technical I think wish should be viewed more as a tech company than just e-commerce. IMHO Wish‚Äôs true value is its marketing algorithms and use of data & relevancy, and I think it‚Äôs really misunderstood because everyone associated it with Chinese crap. I mean who doesn‚Äôt own something from China?? But imagine how they‚Äôre able to achieve such revenue and GMV numbers, especially if they‚Äôre selling cheap crap from China which I can probably assume has a low transaction value on average. That means to make $2-3bn in revenue, imagine the level of volume of transactions on their platform and number of packages being shipped daily. This company‚Äôs technology can literally sell you shit from China over and over again and make billions in revenue with decent growth year over year. That, IMO, isn‚Äôt fuken easy. It‚Äôs not perfect since I know s&m cost needs to be contained, but it‚Äôs part of maturing their tech/business. But they prove their tech can sell ‚Äújunk‚Äù, it can find the right buyers in the right country with the right pocket cash to spend on something from china. I know it sounds ridiculous but I mean if you can make billions by getting people to repeatedly buy crap straight from China, imagine what else they can do down the road. 

TLDR; IMO I think Wish has growing pains but they got cash and tech to improve. I think their technology is the real value here and e-commerce is just medium to show off how powerful their marketing tech is, which will open doors to more opportunities down the road.",cvkcap,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfn7qe/wish_absurd_price_might_be_a_double_in_less_than/gyo3wfs/,0.127,0.719,0.154,0.6252

""HAGENS BERMAN, NATIONAL TRIAL ATTORNEYS, Encourages ContextLogic (WISH) Investors with Significant Losses to Contact Its Attorneys Now, Securities Class Action Pending
GLOBENEWSWIRE - 5:09 PM ET
SAN FRANCISCO, May 18, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hagens Berman urges ContextLogic Inc. (WISH) investors with significant losses to submit your losses now. A securities class action is pending and certain investors who purchased shares in the company‚Äôs December 2020 IPO or on the open market may have valuable claims.

Class Period: Dec. 13, 2020 ‚Äì May 12, 2021
Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 16, 2021

ContextLogic Inc. (WISH) Securities Class Action:

The complaint alleges that ContextLogic‚Äôs IPO registration documents materially overstated the company‚Äôs business metrics and financial prospects. Specifically, the IPO registration documents touted ContextLogic‚Äôs exponential monthly active user (MAUs) growth, claiming its then108 million MAUs was a key driver of revenue growth.

In reality, by the time of its December 2020 IPO, ContextLogic‚Äôs MAUs had declined materially and the IPO registration documents failed to disclose this known trend reasonably likely to materially impact ContextLogic‚Äôs profitability.

On Mar. 8, 2021, Context reported disappointing 4Q 2020 and full year 2020 results, disclosing its MAUs had already ‚Äúdeclined 10% YoY during Q4 to 104 million.‚Äù

Then, on May 12, 2021, ContextLogic (WISH) announced poor Q1 2021 results, including another 7% drop in MAUs to just 101 million, and the company slashed sales guidance for Q2 2021.

These disclosures caused the price of WISH shares to decline sharply.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre focused on investors‚Äô losses and proving ContextLogic (WISH) overstated MAUs and concealed known trends,‚Äù said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

GLOBENEWSWIRE - 5:09 PM ET
SAN FRANCISCO, May 18, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hagens Berman urges ContextLogic Inc. (WISH) investors with significant losses to submit your losses now. A securities class action is pending and certain investors who purchased shares in the company‚Äôs December 2020 IPO or on the open market may have valuable claims.

Class Period: Dec. 13, 2020 ‚Äì May 12, 2021

ContextLogic Inc. (WISH) Securities Class Action:

The complaint alleges that ContextLogic‚Äôs IPO registration documents materially overstated the company‚Äôs business metrics and financial prospects. Specifically, the IPO registration documents touted ContextLogic‚Äôs exponential monthly active user (MAUs) growth, claiming its then108 million MAUs was a key driver of revenue growth.

In reality, by the time of its December 2020 IPO, ContextLogic‚Äôs MAUs had declined materially and the IPO registration documents failed to disclose this known trend reasonably likely to materially impact ContextLogic‚Äôs profitability.

On Mar. 8, 2021, Context reported disappointing 4Q 2020 and full year 2020 results, disclosing its MAUs had already ‚Äúdeclined 10% YoY during Q4 to 104 million.‚Äù

Then, on May 12, 2021, ContextLogic (WISH) announced poor Q1 2021 results, including another 7% drop in MAUs to just 101 million, and the company slashed sales guidance for Q2 2021.

These disclosures caused the price of WISH shares to decline sharply.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre focused on investors‚Äô losses and proving ContextLogic (WISH) overstated MAUs and concealed known trends,‚Äù said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

Like you said though, the TV contracts are set for now and they made their big move with the network going to Peacock. Those were their true money moves. 

I know they have tried to make some inroads in India so unless that pans out or they can get in China or some other Saudi adjacent country tough to see a significant increase in revenues outside of getting an even better TV deal down the road.

602,JT," My mind is better off than where you found me 

I see that there is more to life than be tangled with you 

Only to be lead into a valley with no herd or water to spare

You returned my body to where you have found me afar 

Which is where I saw my dreams come to me 

It‚Äôs the most beautiful thing I‚Äôve ever seen since I come so far
