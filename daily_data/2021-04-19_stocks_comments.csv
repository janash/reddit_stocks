50,SI," $LOTZ

Consignment based used car retailer tapped into the fleet market and wholesale markets. Their cars are regularly priced 5-15% below SHIFT, Carvana, and Carmax. The operation procedures for their hubs are highly cost effective and they can set them up *fast*. Same time last year they had one hub, they are now penetrating the market in 5 regions and have signed leases on 10 more hubs set to open by year’s end, bringing their total up from 2 hubs in Q1 2020 to 25-30 hubs by Q1 22. They also have like $350M in cash on their books and are trading at a valuation of like $570M. EBITDA is positive on projections from the company for this quarter. I think we’re going to see a massive upset in earnings this quarter, the analysts covering the stock are still estimating non profitability.

Due to the way their business model works, they do not invest in most of their inventory, which takes a large portion of operating expenses for a used car dealer down to zero. They work on a consignment basis returning greater value to their clients, providing a cheaper product for consumers, and enlarging margin for the company. This could be a major disruptive force in the market they operate in. 

Assuming they do not dilute, if they capture 15% of the market share Carvana operates, they’ll be a $200-$250 stock. I literally do not invest in anything except this stock, other than spreads/IC on short term swings. I think this company is massively undervalued and being overlooked by everyone including Wall Street. 10% SI is like average for any ticker these days. Volume is at an all time low.

So in essence, they are a clean beauty products that the self regulated themselves .Their revenue from this alone has been growing over 100% last quarter and 65% YoY.  Their gross margins are over 50%.  

They already spent so much from R&D worth over $1.7 billion . The failed clean biofuel almost took them to the brink until they found their niche on clean beauty products.  But the molecule they produced, they can sell it to 50-100 million a piece.  Only constraint by their manufacturing plant and so they are building more.

They just secured a 600 million upfront partnership deal from their successfully scaling 13 of 13 molecule.

They have the MOAT that can revolutionize the synthetic biology.  Amyris' patented fermentation-based production method - That Yeast machine that makes the molecule.

This is high risk high reward type of play .  Most of their products are not on FDA radar.   From clean biofuels, cosmetics, makeups, baby brands and even cannabinoids etc.  The recent F&F deal with DSM and DSM exercises their warrants for dilution should solidify their balance sheet in their next earnings.

If they are able to complete their new plant in Brazil this year, they projected to be profitable by 2022.

I suggest reading up on IVY, what it is and what value it brings. Please note that IVY is a joint project with Amazon, and currently AWS's most hyped automotive cloud solution.

178,NYT," What I said is sort of a joke lol and is pure speculation. But it’s based off this: 
https://m.imgur.com/a/ggIFTfQ

It’s a 15 page document that was leaked out of the estate of an American astronaut after he died. It’s basically a set of notes taken by a scientist who regularly works as a consultant to the Pentagon named Dr. Eric Davis about his conversation with a top ranking Pentagon official named Admiral Wilson that happened almost 20 years ago.

The admiral says he came across a special access, black budget program at the Pentagon headed by one of the top defense contractors which he doesn’t name  (I think it’s Lockheed Martin, specifically their Skunkworks division). He eventually arranges a meeting with the program director to find out more information and is told that the purpose of the program was to reverse engineer a craft they acquired that was “not of this Earth - not made by man - not by human hands”.

The admiral demands to have access to the program but is denied by the program director after he gets shown a list of people who do have access (no one from the Pentagon or even the rest of the government, not even the president, is on that list. Basically no government oversight.) Admiral Wilson goes all Karen and threatens to complain to his superiors about this and the program director is like “lol go ahead” and when he does, he gets his career threatened and is told to never speak of it again.

If you’re doubting the authenticity of the document, it’s probably real: all of the people mentioned in it are real people. (Dr. Eric Davis was in a recent NYT article a few months ago. I wouldn’t doubt if the next article/bombshell about this topic that comes out is about this leaked document if they can verify it.) Whether or not the conversation took place or if what the program director told the admiral is real is up for debate.

Anyways long story short, if it’s true that Lockheed Martin has a UAV in their possession, $LMT is probably going to be a (very) long term hold, but who knows if they can actually reverse-engineer technology that is probably thousands (or even millions) of years ahead of us within our lifetimes.",LionOfNaples,3,/r/stocks/comments/mts4ne/what_under_the_radar_stock_have_you_been_buying/gv371e1/,0.083,0.827,0.09,-0.3276

203,AMD," Just a note - the marketing terms for semiconductor manufacturing processes don't actually have any standard metric and as such can be a bit misleading. 

The process Intel calls 10nm has similar transistor density to TSMC 7nm process (a bit better than their initial 7nm process, a bit worse than TSMC got after some refinement).

Their 7nm process is also supposed to be superior in that regard to TSMC 5nm. And I'm pretty sure it's actually supposed to be not far behind TSMC 3nm.

So, I'd say that if there are no more delays, Intel and AMD will be on pretty close to equal footing (probably slightly in favour of TSMC process on AMD side of things) on the manufacturing process front around 2023/2024.",opliko95,3,/r/stocks/comments/mts4ne/what_under_the_radar_stock_have_you_been_buying/gv2xca0/,0.059,0.812,0.13,0.8665

With valuations for the market, as a whole, near historic highs, buying SPACs at or near NAV can provide a favorable risk/reward.

Of course, as the share price increases above NAV, the cliched margin of safety declines, and the risk becomes more like that of any other stock.

208,AACQ," A SPAC is less of a traditional “company” and more of an investment vehicle.

The SPAC ticker AACQ which you would buy to invest in ORGN is simply an investment account where the value of the fund is typically equal to the stocks market cap. SPAC shares generally have an “assumed” NAV of $10 since that is what your share is worth if the fund dissolved due to not being able to find a merger company. 

Once the merger takes place, the SPAC and the target company merge and the shares convert.

229,DD," I subscribed and regret it. Also ""Rule Breakers"" list of stocks is *very* similar to the other list of stocks. 

It is a lot of spam e-mails, almost all the stocks  they recommend are overvalued (which they justify because they're to be held 1-3 years - but some of them are so overvalued that still doesn't make sense).

Their DD is often incredibly surface.

They don't offer current market info. Everything is behind the curve. Often, they'll send out a member blast about a stock *after* the stock moves so they can seem like they called it when really they reported it after the fact.

They have ""live"" events which aren't and often amount to pump and dump events.

They constantly drive you to try and buy more of their packages, offers, etc.

As far as their blistering hot percentage returns on the market - it's sketchy AF.

First of all, if you have Tesla/Amazon etc. in your portfolio over the last few years, it's going to bring the rest of your portfolio up a lot.

That doesn't mean the *overall* stock picks are good. It means a few are good and bring the rest up.

A more accurate representation would be to compare stocks individually to track performance since they were selected.

Also, that crazy high percentage doesn't account for the allocation in portfolio (which they don't have specific parameters on). So, yes, Tesla went up 300%, but if you bought 1 share of that at $100 and bought 5,000 shares of a dud company at $200 (and they have lots of duds on their list) that is a 50% loss, then it doesn't mean your portfolio made a 250% return.

I have found zero use for them. They recommend very little that is different from what everyone else recommends.

270,ATH," Lots of joking answers, but if you want a real answer: look at the Japanese lost decade.

In that specific example, both stocks and real estate proved to lose their value.

Bonds held their value due to the Bank of Japan suppressing inflation, but the Fed seems willing to accept inflation. Bonds will be safer then stocks in a crash, but I suppose you want something better.

The best bet for Japanese investors would be the US stock market, but that doesn't really help you. It's highly unlikely that any stock market will perform well if the US market crashes.

What remains then?

Gold, silver and, perhaps, those bitty coins seem like the safest bet.

However, timing is difficult. Those coins are at ATH right now and might go crashing down if tech stocks crash, so in that sense Gold seems like it has a better price point right now.
This is not investment advice, but I think if you were to get good investment advice, Gold or other valuable commodities might be the best choice.

I myself am hedging with the bitty coins though, since I think Gold is on a long term decline vs. those coins. But it's a really bad strategy. Don't do as I do, do as I say.

Should you decide to diversify, my suggestion is to choose a percentage of your portfolio that you want to be hedged (5%? 10%? 30%?) And then ease into it over a few days or weeks.

I think bitties will follow tech stonks in the short term. If APPL and TSLA go down, bitties will go down too. How can they stay up? 
So Gold is a better hedge.

But I think bitties will displace Gold as a store of value. So bitties only go up. 

If I was 100% sure there was gonna be a crash in the next 12 months, I would sell everything now, buy gold and the buy stonks and bitties 2 years from now.

But what if the crash only happens 5 years from now? Or 10 years?

283,USA," When people punish capitalism , they're only hurting themselves. Communism and socialism and every other ism cost us 100 million lives and probably more, historically. I hope you meant to convey that the notion of capitalism as something that is being punished poses a danger to humanity and our markets. I'd also point out that even communist/fascist China uses capitalism even within their broken dangerous inhuman system so that they allow their economies to flourish. But they're unwillingness to take their paws off of free enterprise taints their efforts and ultimately costs them even more meaningful growth. Look at what's going on with the Jack Ma/Alibaba/Ant Group/Communist party debacle. 

But we are in an interesting global economy though I would agree; and there are interesting things going on. But, the economic curve keeps shifting upward and to the right, and the Technology factor like automation during the industrial revolution,  and later the internet, and now the  Block chain is about to revolutionize our world even more. If I remember correctly from my economics courses, The aggregate production function and the makeup of GNP formula pn a macro level talks about this.

Human ingenuity and goodness and the American ideal will always win out in the end. So if we can just get rid of fascist and communist  nonsense once and for all, we'd be greater again. 😉

So I daresay as bad as things may be in certain areas, in other areas we're doing pretty well. I just think people haven't really seen this kind of growth before and we keep breaking records, especially here in the USA. So naturally they're afraid of a crash.

All the tooling of old-auto will become useless, they have to buy most technology (such as batteries and motors, because they are new to them) and are nowhere near the software skills needed.

In my honest opinion, there's a shit ton of marketing and pr fuckery around tesla. 

There's also no urgency to shift the production. Especially since all EV's Tesla included are practically inferior to the most modest ICE.

It's a technology super rushed to the market, way ahead of the necessary integration in the society... there's just proper infrastructure around them yet ... not for mass adoption.


Not sure hoe much of the population lives in a house and can afford to leave their EV charging in their yard. I know 90% of the drivers in my city would be forced to drop wires down from their windows.

There's barley enough parking  as is. Parking with a charger? 10 years away minimum.

And that, kids, is probably why no one is in a rush to ditch the ICE yet.

300,ICE," well... they weren't.

In my honest opinion, there's a shit ton of marketing and pr fuckery around tesla. 

There's also no urgency to shift the production. Especially since all EV's Tesla included are practically inferior to the most modest ICE.

It's a technology super rushed to the market, way ahead of the necessary integration in the society... there's just proper infrastructure around them yet ... not for mass adoption.


Not sure hoe much of the population lives in a house and can afford to leave their EV charging in their yard. I know 90% of the drivers in my city would be forced to drop wires down from their windows.

There's barley enough parking  as is. Parking with a charger? 10 years away minimum.

And that, kids, is probably why no one is in a rush to ditch the ICE yet.

To all those not from Europe who don’t fully understand what is happening. The super league will be created and will fail. Why?

What will happen is, that those clubs that join in the hopes of a way of clearing some of their debt will see their club and players excluded from all UEFA and FIFA tournaments. Even the British government is against it as it would damage their home league. For me it is just a push by hedge funds and US billionaire‘s who want to get into the football action.

339,TV," I remember reading an article about a couple who had next to no capital, but who just got a loan of tens of millions of dollars and started buying and flipping entire apartment buildings. Again, with nothing but a loan from a bank. I was a teenager at the time with a fledgling interest in financial markets, but I remember thinking that this was a respected financial publication and here we are listening to this couple explaining how everyone else is an idiot for not getting a loan from their local bank and flipping apartment buildings, and the magazine I read it from was treating them like they were the smartest people they'd ever interviewed.

I remember people talking about how property was dirt cheap and that prices cannot go anywhere but up - and I'm not even from the U.S. This was a global phenomenon. I remember how TV had nothing but ads of banks pushing loans with fixed interest of only 4% - which in today's negative interest world probably seems ludicrous, but where I'm from, banks stress test your mortgage viability by calculating an interest rate of 6% even today. Also, for a short time, banks were allowed to give out mortgages of like 60 years, and I remember a friend of mine telling me about this couple who worked at the same factory as he did, and they both made minimum wage and still managed to get a mortgage of 1 million euros for 60 years. 

Two months later the factory closed down, I don't know what happened to the couple, but you can't get a mortgage of 60 years here anymore. Law prohibits it.

I was actually very vocal about my skepticism of the whole thing. Not only did the dumbest people in my social circles dish out investment advice, but newspapers and magazines and other publications celebrated the people who took insane risk that they clearly didn't understand. Like ""interest rates can't go up"" (technically they were right), and ""I'm worth 10 million on paper"" - no, they weren't. They had 10 million in liabilities and a slight change in either the property price or the interest rate will mean you'll be liquidating all of your assets. A lot of these people couldn't perform basic percentage calculations - like they couldn't understand why you'd still be in the red if a stock price went down 10% today and rose 10% tomorrow, but they were still being hailed as the people who were proof that Warren Buffett didn't know anything about how to make money in this new world.

I see a lot of that today, again. It's more of a gut feeling: The wrong people are telling you what you should put your money into. I can't predict when it's going to happen, but last time I told people that it was going to happen before 2010. It was a guess back then, and while I was right about it, it was for the wrong reasons so I can't pat myself on the back for it. 

But yeah, people will be really wide-eyed and tell you that everything is better than ever and that a crash cannot happen ever again because everything is so great. Things are so fantastic, that even complete morons are making a killing, so how could anything be wrong? 

How indeed.",Agreeable_Flight_107,24,/r/stocks/comments/mu15nv/experienced_stock_market_people_of_reddit_were/gv39y9z/,0.106,0.759,0.135,0.9706
340,GME," Sort of, yes.  But I didn't see it crossing all sectors.  

I saw real estate being insanely valued and transacted.  Everywhere you turned, amateurs were bragging about being financial geniuses because their house value appreciated.  Everyone that owned a house was trying to use the equity to buy second and third houses, and clucking about how other people would pay their mortgages for them.  Mortgage approvals were a joke.  No down payment, no appraisals, 30 year terms, low rates.  NINJA loans everywhere.  

Everyone, and I do mean everyone, was talking real estate and income property 24x7.  Listings, bidding wars, tactics for winning bids, finding non-public listings, etc.

The most vivid example was a guy we knew who was a nice guy but essentially unemployable. No skills, education, or personal discipline.  Basically a video game addict.

He somehow ""bought"" a pre-construction condo on the strength of what he predicted his income could be if he became a freelance graphic artist and managed to find clients.  

The value of the not-yet-built condo started to rise well above his contracted price.   That difference was considered his equity, and he leveraged that into buying two more pre-construction condos.  His stated plan was that the profits from flipping one condo would pay for his personal condo, and the profits from the other condo would set him up for instant retirement.  It sounds silly today, but at the time, anyone talking like that was just considered normal daily conservation.  (Kind of like how we've heard people since talk about their Apple or Tesla or Ark or GME or krypt-o.)

One condo (his) got finished, and the other two got sucked into the vortex.  He got lucky (if you will) because we were monitoring and nagging him early and often which helped him bail out much earlier than otherwise.  He was still stuck with the personal condo, but had to take on multiple food delivery gigs and his life was spent delivering pizzas and doing car repairs.  

Seeing a non-employed person owning three condos and claiming he was more than halfway to being a ""self made"" millionaire was the capper for me.  We went into a defensive real estate posture, modest house, limited debt.  But lots of investing into other aggressive sectors, which didn't work out that well.  I knew real estate would get smoked but I didn't expect it to hit everything.",Summebride,1,/r/stocks/comments/mu15nv/experienced_stock_market_people_of_reddit_were/gv4arzb/,0.082,0.783,0.135,0.976

In some S P A C s that I  play the momentum game, getting in near NAV based on the management team (APSG, BWAC) .  If I do not like target, I get out before merger.  If I like target, sell half or more to take profits and hold the remainder.  This way I effectively manage downside risk.

I also have IPOE - because I really like their target SoFi, not the mgmt team.

I also took a position in Tuscan Holdings Corp B as a pure momentum play as merger has been announced but it approached NAV.   They have a shareholder vote on April 28 - if I hold past the merger their would have to be significant news.

I also like CC as a momentum play - With both SHW and PPG reporting good quarters and the boom in housing starts, I noticed both has nice upticks this week. With CC being the world largest TiO2 supplier (basic pigment in paint, plasters, caulks) , I am thinking that they will have a similar pop when they report on May 3. (I already hold CC)

I'm sure the vast majority of the EV spac plays are bad, but I haven't looked deep into all the companies, since there is no point.

351,TA," Accessibility was a lot different back in that time. TA analysis and information was a lot more difficulty to obtain since a lot of it was still paid software as far as I'm aware of. You're generally making and doing deals through your agents. 

Early 2000s people were still learning about the internet and the possibility of exchange of information. Free wasn't exactly a term that mainstream society adopted and a lot of skepticism on information found online. 

Stock market was really at the time still not opened that much to the public. And most would likely put it in securities and ETFs like a savings account. College and university students unless they were really interested or in need of money would highly unlikely want to try to access and enter the stock market with low funding accounts especially when each trade would have been charged with costs. No free meals unfortunately. 

A lot of generalization since it's hard to pin point everyone's story. So do take what I say with a grain of salt since not everyone will make the same observations.",lightroasta,1,/r/stocks/comments/mu15nv/experienced_stock_market_people_of_reddit_were/gv3no7p/,0.076,0.841,0.083,0.507

Also if one pumps up good. pull and buy one that is down on the dip. We knew tesla would take a hit to start. Just meant a sale price. 

Crypto went nuts last week. Pulled some out with 20% profit. Put some into tesla when it dipped and put the rest back into crypto as its tanking the last day.

518,IMO," Honestly, just ignore analysts completely, they have their own motivations and interests.

As others said, and as mentioned in the very long \`RISK FACTORS\` section of their fillings, their whole business model is reliant on cryptos. Their financial results depend directly on cryptos valuation and public interest in them.

IMO, investing in Coinbase is the same as investing in an ETF for cryptos + competition risks.

Think about what is actually happening... OK, so more states might legalize, then what?  How many adults will bet money on DKNG contests, how often, and how much total?

Do they have issues with putting up “$X Million Guaranteed” contests and not breaking even if not enough people enter?

Good news in that they have no more bad news to report on 7nm node and they have provided clarity on manufacturing. They are expected to beat street's estimates this quarter since they have stated as much. Look for data center division's revenue and profit for how they are doing. Since this is cyclical, they may do well this quarter.

Notes: 

1. It seems AMD has diverted a lot of their chips manufacturing to data center products. Hence, unavailability of their desktop CPUs in retail market.

560,INTC," The first thing you should understand about Intel before investing is that they're trading at a discount to their competitors for a very good reason. They threw in the towel on producing the most up-to-date chip (i5?) basically saying ""we missed the boat and we can't bring it back"".

The company is also going through some recent C-suite turnover, which is a big reason why the stock started sniffing the $60 range again in the latter half of 2020. 

If you're looking to invest, do yourself a favor and wait until after earnings at the very least. The trend of ""sell the news"" on ERs lately is rock-solid, and I don't think INTC is going to have any information in this upcoming ER that's going to pleasantly surprise the market. 

If you're betting on INTC right now, you're betting on a serious company turnaround. Not quite full-Blackberry mode, but close. Tread lightly. In my opinion, $60 is too high right now.

If not, then just move on.

Stocks generally trade closer to ATHs than their lows. Just because the market is growing doesn't mean doom and gloom. Market goes up over time.

I use a 1yr chart, & look at stochastics, RSI, MACD & moving average, sometimes BBands.  And will check charts on at least 2 platforms (ToS, TDAmeriT, TradingView, YahooFinance).

Look at chart on $URA.  I'm mad bullish on this.  Right now its riding the bottom of an upward price channel, & should pop above $20.  Dividend only pays out 2x/yr: June & Dec, so thats coming up soon.  Normally I sell covered calls on my positions, but Im not on URA cause I dont want to get called out before dividends (this has happened to me with $PHG).

I check positions on my phone a few times per day, just to check on things.  Otherwise Im going on about my business.  Also depends on what kind of positions I have
For example, Im short Peleton, so I'll be checking a little more frequently.  When I was short gold, I was also checking much more due to volitility & me being leveraged.

608,GME," GME already had a share sale program. The old program allowed them to sell a maximum of 6 million shares, raising at most 100 million USD. They didn't have to sell everything, but at most they could sell 6 million shares or raise at most 100 million, once one of those numbers was reached the program was done.
They recently announced a change to this plan, they will now sell at most 3.5 million shares, with a cap of 1 billion USD. So they expect to raise 10x as much money while selling slightly over half the shares they planned to before.

623,PTON," >you can find much cheaper and better alternatives than a $2000 bike with a screen attached to it

Yes, but that doesn't make the product ""bad."" You can find cheaper and better alternatives to an iPhone as well, but Apple's stock isn't exactly plummeting. Peloton makes a very solid bike, the classes are high quality and the brand, at least in the fitness space, is comparable to Apple and Tesla. You mention the cult following, but I think you downplay it a bit, as its supremely important. People with Peloton bikes are irritatingly enthusiastic about it, recommending it to everyone and posting their rides on social media.

>The target audience is people who wanna pay money to feel like they're working out, not people who actually exercise.

I think this is a bit hyperbolic - having access to 24/7 spin classes in your home, as well as the wealth of other classes available (strength, running, yoga, pilates, etc) isn't some sort of fake exercise like you seem to be implying here. It's legitimate and works if you put in the work (and after spending what you must to enter the ecosystem, I think a lot of people do). 

But, I understand the sentiment - big time fitness gurus don't need instagram celebrities motivating them to get on a bike a few times a week. They're hitting the gym regularly and likely have a full home gym that probably cost them less than the PTON bike alone. They really aren't the Peloton target market - but I think the market for people who just want to be in better shape, have some extra cash and want to own the latest shiny thing is probably bigger and easier to penetrate anyways. Many of these people do not like the gym and would welcome the opportunity to stay in shape in their bedroom or basement.

Finally, my other bull scenario for Peloton is them actually getting their bikes into more public spaces like gyms, hotels and office spaces. COVID created a lot of new Peloton owners who wanted to work out from home, but obviously, COVID is (hopefully) on its way out and those customers are returning to the real world. Would be great if they could take their Peloton login and jump on a bike anywhere they might normally work out, and it would really cement Peloton's place in the fitness world.",LookAnOwl,1,/r/stocks/comments/mu45ha/good_opportunity_to_grab_some_pton/gv3s2en/,0.028,0.786,0.186,0.9968
624,GME," Don't do any business with Robinhood ever. They are not a good company. Doge is type of crypto that was invested as a joke and there is an infinite supply of it so it can never truly be worth as much as real coins with a limited supply. Doge is a fomo play distraction, which means no one is actually buying it either than punks and dumps and that is the Worst way to buy and fastest way to lose your money. Coinbase is a simple to use crypto app but you can not purchase doge on it. In order to purchase it you will most likely have to use two apps, one to purchase the coin and one to transfer it to a broker.

If you really want a play like that I would suggest buying a share of GME, even if a squeeze never happens, you are buying a great stock for the long term. Many people believe it may be worth millions, but even if it is not, it is much safer than Doge.",ExistentialCricket,2,/r/stocks/comments/mu3crt/which_app_should_i_use/gv3i0iz/,0.094,0.779,0.127,0.9052

650,PEI, Actually the better play is to buy their preferred stock.  Their preferred stock also pays a dividend that has been suspended.  Their preferred stock has a par value \[price that the original stock was issued at\] of $25 and is currently selling for $9.28.  The reason to buy the preferred is that all of the dividends that were supposed to be paid to stock holders of the preferreds has to be paid first before the normal PEI stock can pay a dividend.  At this rate they owe me 3 quarters of dividends ($.4295 \[dividend\] x 3 \[quarters\] = $1.29/ share.   Am thinking of buying a small quantity more to increase my eventual dividend payoff.,limestone2u,2,/r/stocks/comments/mu4icm/pei_undervalued_reopening_play_deep_value_dd/gv3zvjx/,0.038,0.836,0.126,0.8511

652,PEI," Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment (PEI) has 3 preferred stocks - PEI-pB, PEI-pC, and PEI-pD.  I specifically own PEI-pD and that is one I know has the catch-up dividend provision.  I believe the other two (C & B) do also but am not sure without checking.  In addition to PEI-pD also own PEI.

&#x200B;

PEI - the non-preferred stock - does not have the catch-up dividend provision.   So after  I get all of my delayed dividends, at their full dividend before their suspension,  the regular stock PEI will then and only then can PEI be able to pay a dividend on their common stock.  PEI's new dividend can be as low as $.01 up to the $.02 \[like it was before it was cancelled\]or maybe higher.  Doubt seriously if they will start paying out $.21/share for the common dividend immediately.  Think they will start out at $.01 to $.02/share.   But my dividend on the preferred has to be  paid first and be current before the common stock can get paid.  And it has to be @ $.4295/share.

662,AC," It is the worse thing that you can ever do to football. These are big european football sharks that want to fill up their pockets even more. Not their retail investors and for sure not their fans.

This is basically a way of saying: Look, UCL and EL is all fun and games but it kinda of sucks we having to share our money other 36 clubs, most of them from countries with lower leagues. So... why don't we create our own league where we don't have to play them, risking embarassent if we loose and divide the profits amount us? And don't worry we will leave 5 places for the rest of the teams to have the opportunity to join in, in case you guys want to accuse us of elitism.

Now, this is the worse thing that you can do to any kind of sport that has the main target since its creation to be inclusive. Everyone, and I mean 99,99% that actually care about the sport are agaisnt. From Federations, National leagues, other clubs (like Bayern, Dortmund or FC Porto that were invited and refused), UEFA, FIFA, football players, coaches and most important the fans.

There a clubs joining that in the past few years are far from achieving good results: AC Milan, Internazionale and M. United are good examples of it. In the past years they are even having a hard time getting to UCL, yet alone win it, with clubs like Ajax, Shaktar, Roma, FC Porto, Dortmund getting the best out of them.

This is nothing but a fake coup agaisnt UEFA to gain more money, attention and get some new changes (like UCL going for 36 clubs) undone. Proof of this? Read the latest Barcelona FC press realese where they admit that they have the biggest interest in keeping conversations with UEFA and FIFA to improve the quality of already existing competitions.

Even if this goes foward there is one more isue: Some clubs have to do elections to see if this gets approved. Not shareholders elections but fans elections and that will never pass in at least 2-3 clubs.

And UEFA, FIFA and football federations won't let this go easy. They will be blocked from entering UCL and EL, but also national leagues plus they can prohibit players to go in international duty.

So, football wise... this is might be the worse decision and by far the most contested one for decades and for it to go all the way... it is a long shot.

With that said, I disagree with you when you consider that this is a good opportunity to stock up on football clubs stocks. On paper it might look like they will be victorious and they will double their revenue but... the chances of that happening are minimal

668,AC," More information from the past hours regarding this issue, coming directly from Alexander Ceferin, the UEFA president:

""“We will try to use all the sanctions against the Super League clubs. As soon as possible they have to be BANNED from all our competitions, players too”. 

 “These are so-called big clubs, it is clear that the big clubs of today were not always big clubs. Juventus were in Serie B, Man United before Sir Alex Ferguson was I don't know where”.  (BIG OOFF)

""We will do the sanctions we can do within the law, of course”. 

 “The players that will play in the Super League will be banned from playing in the World Cup and Euros. Ceferin. They will not be allowed play for their national teams”.  

In terms of stocks, this clubs will most likely be sanction this season already, both monetarly and with bans from International Competitions where they get most of their millions (prizes, views, tickets, sponsors, players). If this is confirmed... what OP would think it would be amazing for the clubs its going to destroy them financially when they are already crippled from Covid. Plus more and more players are coming out against the Super League, players from said teams, such as Bruno Fernandes from M.United or João Cancelo from M. City.

Moreover this:

""Serie A clubs will meet today afternoon to talk about Super League situation - Juventus, Inter and AC Milan will not attend the meeting.  

Spanish clubs are planning for a meeting on Thursday to discuss about Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atléti position after joining Super League.""

National leagues are also planning to sanction the clubs just for what happened in the last 24h. I can tell you that both the Italian and Spanish leagues do not go easy on punishments
