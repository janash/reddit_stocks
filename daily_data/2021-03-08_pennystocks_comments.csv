0,CEO," Love High Tide. So many reasons why I am holding long and strong on this and have so much faith in Raj (the CEO of High Tide.)

1. They are opening at least 2 stores every month, and as their goal is to hit 120+ store by EOY, they are on track to that.
2. year-to-year growth in revenue and profit
3. one of the only marijuana companies profitable at this early stage
4. legalization coming in the US and around the world
5. first move advantage into online retail
6. proficient CEO with growth-oriented policies
7. heavily under-priced with analysts listing target prices in the 1.15$ range

on top of all those, earnings will probably be on the 1st week of April, where Meta earning's will be included.

One strategy I've seen for penny stocks is to sell 50% of your shares once the price doubles, so that you make your money back and can feel more secure about holding.

The Company have approval from FDA for KP415. 
Due $48m in cash + existing cash on balance sheet
Likely to have $100m cash at next reporting date, against $180m market cap (no debt). $1m / quarter cash burn
The Company potentially has upwards of $450m milestones due (depending on sales hurdles) and will receive 20% royalties from sales of the drug. 
The drug is in circulation in 2H this year - very soon
That means c. $80m of value attributed to future cash flow profitability from the sale of drugs.. this is ludicrous
Add short squeeze pressure coming up in mid March - as the shorts roll off. Shorts were placed pre-FDA approval as a punt by some institutions.
This should go astronomical

132,BB," Marketwatch and yahoo finance will tell you about analyst evaluations and price targets. Keep in mind these are just predictions. Just because the price target is 15 dollars does not mean the shares will ever reach that price. Analysts also change their price targets periodically, and this might be bad for you. BB for example has been struggling since an analyst moved his price target from like 13 to 7.56 or so. It was trading around 12 at the time, now it trades between 9 and 11. 

Volume is a key indicator. When the volume spikes over it's 10 day average that is a good sign the price might go up (if the volume of buyers goes up, down if the volume of sellers is up). Some people will tell you to read the candlestick charts. That is like an artform. I'm not there yet, I only recently learned how to even look at a candlestick chart and know what it means.

178,IR," I hear what you're saying here, and also thanks for the friendly and measured questions / critique.  It's true the SP action has been baffling in comparison to competitors like CBDT. There's has been a lot of discussion on this over at ceo.ca and yes HFT and manipulation of this stock on low volume is definitely part of the problem.

I think this manipulation and SP slump along with a lack of Investor Relations caused investors who bought on the last leg up to loose faith and begin selling, further eroding the price. However, putting money into an IR campaign is far from unorthodox... It's common and many companies have multiple in-house staff that do this work year round. MEDV launching an IR campaign is a good thing and shows they believe they have upcoming news that warrants such an expense.
