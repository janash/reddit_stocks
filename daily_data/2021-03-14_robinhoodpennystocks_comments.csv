1,DD," Not directed at the OP or anything but just a quick tip guys. If you start with $100 and lose $50, you lost 50%

But to go from $50 back to $100 you now need to gain 100% of your current portfolio just to get back even. People automatically assume if you lose a few percent you just need to gain that same percentage back, but in reality that's not true, it's exponentially harder with your now lower capital

This means that your theoretical historical values are derived, not actual, and can result in some crazy % gains.

I analyzed my own 2020 transaction deposit / withdrawal history and validated that the % is totally inaccurate of a time-weighted reflection.

132,TMBR, TMBR. It's at $2.50 right now but it has huge potential to run with any kind of PR. It's been heavily shorted last few weeks.  On ssr monday so some run possible even without PR. Many promising products in phase 2 or 3.,grey_bush314,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m52av0/suggestions_for_swing_trades/gqxp7cn/,0.063,0.873,0.064,0.0163
133,DD, You‚Äôre up 36 percent it appears. You‚Äôre doing incredibly well. Trust your DD and analyze the charts. If you believe your price target just wait it out. If you‚Äôre just trying to flip weekly or daily keep learning new ways to analyze charts to maximize your trading. It really depends on what approach you‚Äôre trying to take. I can‚Äôt stress enough though how being up 36 percent is fantastic. I understand it‚Äôs a bull market and GameStop and everyone posting 200 percent gains might make it feel like it‚Äôs not much but it‚Äôs way above average by an insane amount,Vincent_Jay,4,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m4m540/talk_me_out_of_selling_for_a_loss_when_youre/gqwhkf9/,0.052,0.856,0.093,0.3151
134,DD," With penny stocks for me all about short term gains. Short term DD, average down when need be, trailing stop loss and a percentage of gains as it moves upward and sell at the top. No emotional attachment. I hate the stock. I love money.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)",The-Night-Raven,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m4m540/talk_me_out_of_selling_for_a_loss_when_youre/gqwkoso/,0.182,0.559,0.26,0.5411
135,RH," Depending how fast you need the money, you can take a small portion of free cash and average your cost basis down. Buy the stock you're down on and sell it the next time you're up or break even. Then buy it again. Repeat until your average is low enough to go green or take a smaller loss. You can also sell calls if you have 100 shares to further lower your average, but RH will not recognize this and say you are taking a huge loss. For example, if your average is 1.50 on 100 shares, and you sell a call against those shares for $25, you're lowered your average to 1.25 but RH will show 1.50. 

This is my strategy to lower my averages on stocks I like to hold. Its worked well so far, but you need to understand how the stocks move on the daily to time when to get in n out to not get your second purchase stuck underwater.",Undeadguy1704,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m4m540/talk_me_out_of_selling_for_a_loss_when_youre/gqvyynx/,0.083,0.815,0.102,0.6597
136,TRCH," I don‚Äôt hold bags. If a stock dives, and I‚Äôm red, but I believe that the stock will recover in the next week or two, I‚Äôll hold. Otherwise I‚Äôm out, and kicking myself for not getting out earlier. 

That money rotting could be used for genuine plays that have serious growth potential. 

For example, you are holding biotechs and the whole sector corrects. You are down 30%. They will make a slow recovery over the next month or two. You see a stock with a genuine catalyst (like TRCH with a merger vote yesterday. You can sell those lazy biotechs, buy into the catalyst stock, sell on the run up and double your money, ending up with no bags and profit overall. 

I don‚Äôt get the mental struggle to sell at a loss. Just dump it and put that money to work. You can always buy back into the stock later if it shows some life",1Angry_Banana,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m4m540/talk_me_out_of_selling_for_a_loss_when_youre/gqv9n5r/,0.102,0.839,0.059,-0.7227

139,GME," Depends on the stocks, but usually over the long term you‚Äôll do better holding than acting emotionally in the short term. That said, I sold RKT for a 50% loss and used GME to almost make it all back - sometimes abandoning a bad play (hopefully before 50% lol) is the right call if you see an opportunity for growth elsewhere.

Or you could get double wrecked, this isn‚Äôt financial advice.",Even_Story7605,5,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m4m540/talk_me_out_of_selling_for_a_loss_when_youre/gqv6kv6/,0.13,0.705,0.165,0.4497
