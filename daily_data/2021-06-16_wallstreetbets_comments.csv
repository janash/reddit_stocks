33,AMC," Or the basement.  Have you see the Bookmap on AMC?  It's a wall of enormous limit sells and then almost no limit buys underneath that holding it up.  Considering that at least check it's 80% held by retail this is mostly apes looking for the exits but being unrealistically greedy and trying to shitpost it higher.

That huge sell spike at $75 might trigger due to delta hedging but have you really taken a good look at the option chain?  After Friday there's nothing holding it up at all on that front.  If any kind of gamma action happens it's gonna unwind and unwind hard.  That chain is so fucked up right now, August 20 145c has a delta of 0.45.  That's as low as it goes any time soon, no good will come of this.

I wouldn't be surprised to see it under $30 in 2 weeks and then bagholding intensifies.

I don't hold any position on AMC, I'm into even dumber shit than that, stuff which frankly nobody with two brain cells to rub together should ever attempt.  I'm not telling you what to do, but try looking around.

So GME is shorted...you all buy all shares in float...shorters bid the moon to cover...(hence what happened)....you sell you shares to them...you own a fortune..shorter losses 1 bln (or more), shares are owned by HF...who becomes new holder...dont want to sell at loss..hence price is what it is....  


now...if you apes re-invest your 1bln profit....(or only half of it) into

what is there to play for with AMC and GME??? they are on the moon...nothing more to do...yes occasionally they (AMC) are shorted again...10..20%  but with freefloat of 500mln share (AMC) the chances are low that they cant cover...

Now as you and fellow apes keep saying that others are distraction you are only playing onto the hands of HF...like citadel ;-)  


As far as I understand this is how it works: 10mln WSB apes say avg 10k on their investment account = 100bln $..WSB FUND  


So GME is shorted...you all buy all shares in float...shorters bid the moon to cover...(hence what happened)....you sell you shares to them...you own a fortune..shorter losses 1 bln (or more), shares are owned by HF...who becomes new holder...dont want to sell at loss..hence price is what it is....  


now...if you apes re-invest your 1bln profit....(or only half of it) into  
1 other share...you will have the next squeeze...  


what is there to play for with AMC and GME??? they are on the moon...nothing more to do...yes occasionally they (AMC) are shorted again...10..20%  but with freefloat of 500mln share (AMC) the chances are low that they cant cover...

So in my opinion....cash (part of) your bananas....inform the other Apes in the cage....do DD on the next squeeze....reinvest and squeeze

BTW tomorrow is the 18th...another opportunity to launch a rocket ship

202,AMC," So let me share what I have been doing and I only trade options since early this year.

1 options contract = 100 shares
You can buy and sell options
Options prices goes up and down if the stocks goes up and down 
If the options expire they are worthless 
If you have the money you can exercise the option 
If you don‚Äôt have the money to exercise just sell it if in the money 

Follow me so far?

HF are f‚Ä¶ with the AMC stock. When there is a big dip the prices of options drop.

I buy an option away from the money which is cheaper 2 months away.

Stock prices go up. Options price goes up. I Sell options before it dips again or start dipping. A part of profit buy more stock to keep buying pressure and add to my positIons.

Market Chatter: BlackBerry Blasted On Executive Pay as Reddit Rally Enriches CEO John Chen  
BY MT Newswires  
‚Äî 10:30 AM ET 06/15/2021  
10:30 AM EDT, 06/15/2021 (MT Newswires) -- An influential proxy advisory firm is blasting BlackBerry Ltd. ( BB   
Loading...  
Loading...  
) (BB.TO, BB) over its executive compensation practices, BNN Bloomberg is reporting Tuesday.  
In a scathing report ahead of the tech company's June 23 annual general meeting, Glass Lewis recommended investors vote against BlackBerry's executive pay plan, and said the company's compensation compared with overall corporate performance merits an ""F"" grade.  
At the core of the issue is BlackBerry's share-based compensation plan, the report said. Glass Lewis noted that the recent Reddit-fuelled rally in shares of the company could result in outsized share awards compared to the underlying fundamentals of the business.  
Glass Lewis said that the long-term incentives outlined in fiscal 2019, combined with the rally, could result in BlackBerry Chair and Chief Executive Officer John Chen receiving $106 million in performance share units (PSUs) and restricted share units (RSUs), along with a $90-million cash incentive.  
Tuesday's report noted the PSU performance hurdles -- ascending price targets between $16 and $20 per share on a volume-weighted average price basis -- have been easier to achieve during the current mania. Glass Lewis noted that three out of the five PSU tranches were achieved, unlocking three million PSUs.  
At the height of the frenzy, shares of BlackBerry peaked north of $30, though they have since slid to $17.  
In the report, Glass Lewis said that given the anomalous nature of the Reddit rally, it appeared those share awards were divorced from the fundamentals shown by the company prior to the frenzy.  
""Based on the company's share price performance over the past fiscal year -- prior to January 2021 the price hovered around $5 and peaked around $8.50 -- it appears to us that these tranches were earned as a result of the company's sudden share price increase concurrent with the retail trading phenomenon observed in January 2021, which was characterized by extremely volatile trading patterns of shares in certain publicly traded brands, most famously GameStop.""

Market Chatter: BlackBerry Blasted On Executive Pay as Reddit Rally Enriches CEO John Chen

10:30 AM EDT, 06/15/2021 (MT Newswires) -- An influential proxy advisory firm is blasting BlackBerry Ltd. ( BB

) (BB.TO, BB) over its executive compensation practices, BNN Bloomberg is reporting Tuesday.  
In a scathing report ahead of the tech company's June 23 annual general meeting, Glass Lewis recommended investors vote against BlackBerry's executive pay plan, and said the company's compensation compared with overall corporate performance merits an ""F"" grade.  
At the core of the issue is BlackBerry's share-based compensation plan, the report said. Glass Lewis noted that the recent Reddit-fuelled rally in shares of the company could result in outsized share awards compared to the underlying fundamentals of the business.  
Glass Lewis said that the long-term incentives outlined in fiscal 2019, combined with the rally, could result in BlackBerry Chair and Chief Executive Officer John Chen receiving $106 million in performance share units (PSUs) and restricted share units (RSUs), along with a $90-million cash incentive.  
Tuesday's report noted the PSU performance hurdles -- ascending price targets between $16 and $20 per share on a volume-weighted average price basis -- have been easier to achieve during the current mania. Glass Lewis noted that three out of the five PSU tranches were achieved, unlocking three million PSUs.

310,WH," This is going to open a whole can of worms in certain communities if it is passed. I dont think it will pass and here is my short take: 

In some areas, the going talk on why crime and more specifically, violent crime is so high and has been for so long is because of the illegal drug market. Whenever that market opens up, and crime is still rampant, certain people run out of excuses on why things are still status quo. Additionally, you think these higher crime cities who profit from throwing people into the jail system are just going to allow their coffers to dry up? 

over 1,500,000 arrests in 2019 for drug-related offenses (per FBI). That's a LOT of fine and bail money, and lawyer money, money going into jails that make money from inmate counts. Free community service labor, and everything else that wraps into these programs, like paying for counseling or classes etc. You think the local governments are going to be all like ""yeah, that's cool, take that huge chunk of money from us"" without a fight? Else, where do they then recoup that lost income that sadly counted on year after year after decade after forever? Hell, someone in the WH made her bones throwing a LOT of people in jail and prison over drugs, and bragged about it. 

With any of that in mind, let's say they do pass this. Where are plays to be made in making money that arent as obvious as ""lol buy weed stock""",lispychicken,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o13b6v/firstever_congressional_bill_to_decriminalize_all/h1zwgxi/,0.137,0.76,0.103,-0.9436

318,GPS," For those that question the tech. 

Many people are working on solving this problem including the Chinese government. 
https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-china-54852131

From a physics stand point, its radio wave communication - your phone has GPS and that connects to a satellite in the sky, that also is a radio wave with a different protocol then cellular.

Iridium which is in production today uses satellites to enable cellular communication when you get stuck on Mount Everest and you need to call your wife that you will be late for dinner. They just have a special device because they don't have access to the wireless spectrum of the telecoms. Their devices are also much larger because they need more power to connect to a smaller satellite. 

Has it been proven that a normal cell phone can connect to a satellite and send a message ?

It was proven by lynk - [https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/lynk-sends-the-first-text-message-from-space-directly-to-a-normal-cell-phone/](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/lynk-sends-the-first-text-message-from-space-directly-to-a-normal-cell-phone/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAD0P-BL09SeC2yr15DWwUv3amOBUq7fAl5dVHhwHbVi6pRV-iJ2H878jTbVErj0RqaAqLZB_qKnLXVXCMpZKSQNrXQc5q0dbG-RB-qdRxyGacYwtMIliN8qjUStt8gxZOfHZhGhLxpimHnLxDwkJA4CZe4p4aAZZdIyrFguuUNaI)

""It works, as founder and CEO Charles Miller explained to me last year, very much the way normal cell signals work. It turns out that when your radio beam goes straight up instead of passing through buildings and the landscape, it can easily reach low Earth orbit. The problem comes with the physics involved in synchronizing the signals ‚Äî doppler shift and other factors.""


Lynk is using much smaller satellites so they have more latency and more data limitations. 

AST tested this with Bluwalker 1 and are saying to us that the latency is going to be around 40-60ms.

AST CEO explains in this article how its a math equation and their technology just uses a lot larger satellites to ensure low latency. You can read more about it here.

320,GB," > The satellite itself is not complex

This statement is dubious. The bent-pipe architecture simplifies some types of satellite design (not needing to design inter-satellite links like many have done) but a 900m^2 aperture is never going to be simple. As someone who works in the space industry myself, I wish them all the best in this endeavor, but it's going to be a long hard slog to get a deployable structure that big to work successfully. It will also require some incredible engineering effort. 

The biggest barriers as I see them in the near future for these folks are:


1) Licensing - they must get a license to operate this service in each country that they wish to market in. A good thing/bad thing of LEO is that your satellites only spend tens of minutes over an individual country, so you need to launch in many countries to properly capatalize your asset. This provides many potential roadblock opportunities for competition (both space-based and terrestrial) to stop you at each license fight. Additionally, they're looking to use existing spectrum, which means coordination agreements with every single carrier or *a lot* of interference potential. They are partnering with existing carriers to coordinate, which is good, but they still need to get licensed to send those same bands *from space.*

2) Technology - To realize their plans, AST & Science will need to develop the largest space deployable structure in human history, as there is no launch vehicle large enough to directly launch it. The aperture sizes that are proposed are *rumored* to have existed at this size on ""spooky"" national intelligence satellites with price tags in the billions. Far be it from me to say that anything is impossible, that's not my nature, but this will be an extremely difficult development project. For reference, this is a ~17m diameter dish/phased array, which will need to be true to shape within ~1-2 mm to realize sidelobe targets. 

Additionally, they have not detailed how thet plan to do beam-steering from this large aperture size to properly cover a large area on the ground. If they're in LEO with a 900m^2 aperture in the S-band, the spot size on the ground is going to be ~6-10 km in diameter. With ~200 satellites, and one aperture per satellite, they're going to need to either beam-hop like crazy or do more than one beam per aperture somehow to get full coverage. Otherwise, they get about 0.012% of the Earth's surface area at a time. 

3) Space Operations Experience - Bluewalker1 is a nanosatellite, with no manuvering capability or attitude control system. This means that as far as the rest of the space community is concerned, this satellite is a ""dumb brick"" which requires no active coordination with the company that launched it (manuverable sats will just have to dodge it).

321,LEO," > The satellite itself is not complex

This statement is dubious. The bent-pipe architecture simplifies some types of satellite design (not needing to design inter-satellite links like many have done) but a 900m^2 aperture is never going to be simple. As someone who works in the space industry myself, I wish them all the best in this endeavor, but it's going to be a long hard slog to get a deployable structure that big to work successfully. It will also require some incredible engineering effort. 

The biggest barriers as I see them in the near future for these folks are:


1) Licensing - they must get a license to operate this service in each country that they wish to market in. A good thing/bad thing of LEO is that your satellites only spend tens of minutes over an individual country, so you need to launch in many countries to properly capatalize your asset. This provides many potential roadblock opportunities for competition (both space-based and terrestrial) to stop you at each license fight. Additionally, they're looking to use existing spectrum, which means coordination agreements with every single carrier or *a lot* of interference potential. They are partnering with existing carriers to coordinate, which is good, but they still need to get licensed to send those same bands *from space.*

2) Technology - To realize their plans, AST & Science will need to develop the largest space deployable structure in human history, as there is no launch vehicle large enough to directly launch it. The aperture sizes that are proposed are *rumored* to have existed at this size on ""spooky"" national intelligence satellites with price tags in the billions. Far be it from me to say that anything is impossible, that's not my nature, but this will be an extremely difficult development project. For reference, this is a ~17m diameter dish/phased array, which will need to be true to shape within ~1-2 mm to realize sidelobe targets. 

Additionally, they have not detailed how thet plan to do beam-steering from this large aperture size to properly cover a large area on the ground. If they're in LEO with a 900m^2 aperture in the S-band, the spot size on the ground is going to be ~6-10 km in diameter. With ~200 satellites, and one aperture per satellite, they're going to need to either beam-hop like crazy or do more than one beam per aperture somehow to get full coverage. Otherwise, they get about 0.012% of the Earth's surface area at a time. 

3) Space Operations Experience - Bluewalker1 is a nanosatellite, with no manuvering capability or attitude control system. This means that as far as the rest of the space community is concerned, this satellite is a ""dumb brick"" which requires no active coordination with the company that launched it (manuverable sats will just have to dodge it). Once they intend to operate a real constellation, they will need to develop propulsion hardware, attitude control and determination hardware and software, autonomous collision avoidance software, and a team of operations staff to fly and manage the constellation and coordinate with other operators. This is a significant undertaking. 

4) Total bandwidth per satellite - 1.2MM GB/month sounds good when you say it that way, but that's only ~3.6 gigabits per second per satellite (assuming GB in the post is giga**bytes**, to be charitable). That puts total constellation throughput at ~a single high quality fiber line.

\- They are launching BW3 out of Kazakhstan on board a Soyuz ride share.  The satellite's aperture will be mechanically unfolded, but I don't know the exact specifics. 

\- Yes the spectrum coordination is part of the magic and complexity.  No one said this is going to be easy!  But working with carriers as you point out is critical.  Having access to the best propagating spectrum will also come with technical challenges to avoid interference.

\- BW3 launch is intended to test and tweak propulsion.

353,GEO," Whether the OP intended to or not, they definitely made the satellite system sound like the easy part. Their risks are about things like cell phone battery life, for example. 

I'm extremely curious to read those notes, I think especially getting to a good understanding of how they plan to steer beams and cover large areas of the world would be really important. 

As it stands, the satellites just seem to me to have too small of a spot size, too low of a per-sat bandwidth, and too few of them to get to an effective global coverage system without a ton of beam hopping or defocused coverage (and consequential loss of latency and/or throughput). I'm happy to be proven wrong! Obviously there are smart people working at that company, and they have chosen their system design for a reason. 

The deployables development is always going to be technically possible, as long as atoms can exist in that shape there's some way to get them there.

GEO systems typically fold 2-6m apertures, which fit into existing fairings and just basically have a hinge off of the bus. The really fancy ones fold down the middle.

Go look at the 10 year yield since 1980, it has been declining steadily to near-zero levels. Given the nature of the government debt, the Fed cannot raise interest rates and will keep them down so long as they are not concerned with high inflation (hmmm... inflation can be triggered in theory by convincing people there will be inflation, so that works for Burry as well).

Only time will tell whether Burry is right or wrong, but being right or wrong here does not mean there was a need for him to be right. How people emotionally react can be in large part the determinant in the outcome of all this. Not unlike how retail deciding to jump on AMC enabled it to raise funds and avoid bankruptcy. If people think to hoard cash and not spend it then inflation won't happen no matter how much the government prints. Inflation stays down, the Fed will keep the yields down.

Part of disruption to the supply chain is that people are able to afford more than they ever have before because of getting some extra cash and these low rates. Banks are willing to lend out the money because the underwriting works out. 

My question is‚Ä¶ what is going to happen when that stops? Buying will stop & consumer spending will go down.. Is that going to lead to a massive crash? Will it curb inflationary prices? No one knows but all the scenarios are on the table.

605,AMC," 1. Float size: WISH share float is around 338 million shares. Comparatively, UWMC is around 80m. WISH is 4x harder to move.

Float size is very loosely correlated with volatility. Volume is the most important variable. And Wish's volume today was 140M shares vs UWMC 6M. If you think otherwise, you clearly haven't been paying attention to AMC's run.

2) Dilution: IF WISH does rise again, they will keep dropping offerings on our heads. The UWMC CEO has already stated that he believes the company is undervalued and they have a share buyback program, there will be no dilution to stop the party.

How do you know that? Companies that have been dropping offerings are those that are massively overvalued according to analysts. Gamestop, AMC. Sure if WISH goes 10x like these two, they'll probably drop an offering, as would UWMC and literally even the most wsb friendly companies. But Wish is still massively undervalued according to analysts. WISH management is the least likely to drop an offering. Not to mention the whopping 1.6 Billion UWMC shares that various insiders can drop at any time. 

3) Option chain: Most of UWMC's options are ITM or ATM, whereas most of WISH's call options are OTM. This means that the closer we get to friday at the current price, the more buying pressure UWMC will have and the less WISH will have due to the difference in options that need to be hedged for. This is extremely important and combined with float size is a large reason why UWMC is such a good play for this week. Every day at open the stock is assaulted by shorts because they don't want the $10 calls to stay ITM, but with more volume this stock would explode.

[https://www.barchart.com/options/volume-leaders/stocks](https://www.barchart.com/options/volume-leaders/stocks)

Most traded options today. ctrl f UWMC nothing. Yes most of WISH's are otm. But those 11c for friday are bigger than the totality of UWMC itm options. If the 12.50 get in, then all hell would break loose. Such a thing is impossible for UWMC's tiny volume. If the UWMC 10c dont make it?

4) IV: Not only is the UWMC float smaller making it easier to move, but it has more ITM options at play magnifying that effect. IV is also lower on UWMC (100% vs 250%) making options cheaper by a VERY significant amount, increasing the probability of a very popular well known technical event.

Ya I agree, if you want lottery tickets, buy UWMC calls. Love how you're literally contrading your point #1 where you say that UWMC's volatility or as you call it ""ability to move"" is higher. The market clearly believes that WISH can move, unlike UWMC, hence, higher premiums.

1) yes it's easier to move with a small float - but guess what? It's just as easy to move the stock down as up.

2) RKT also had a buyback announced but they didnt use it. What makes you think UWMC will use it any time soon, especially after the stock price went up quite a bit already recently? Also, because UWMC's has such a low float, buying stock back doesn't make sense, it will just make it easier to manipulate.

2) With all the shenanigans going on, most of the options are covered already. Also, naked call sellers sell OTM options - they don't sell ITM options. That means most of UWMC's option chain is covered, where as if WISH pops there is more of a chance for a gamma squeeze.

4) Lower IV means the volatility is anticipated to be lower - it's like that for a reason, people are pricing in bigger swings for WISH.

""After the Reddit-driven short squeeze in January, WallStreetBets users again turned their attention toward this cannabis stock. One Reddit user wrote in a post last week that Tilray ""is a movement,"" adding that the company has ""fantastic stats"" and is ""a worthy opponent to AMC"" as a meme stock. Per Quiver Quantitative, the cannabis stock was mentioned 922 times on WallStreetBets over the past five days. Shares of TLRY are up just 7.8% so far this month, suggesting that the stock rally is yet to start.

Investors should note that Tilray has emerged as the world's largest cannabis company following its blockbuster merger with Aphria in May. The Canadian cannabis producer has an estimated revenue growth rate of 49.9% and earnings per share growth rate of 84.3% for this fiscal year (ending May 2022). The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 and a Growth Score of A"".

Industry delinquency is something like 4.5% which is not much worse than any other time period. So yes, inventory will finally start to go up as these foreclosed homes become available... but it'll take months for the foreclosure proceedings to finalize and get the houses ready to be listed. I'm super bullish on UWMC, but that's because I see the housing market staying very competitive for the rest of the year. Things will sell quickly and for far too much money until the end of the year.

932,CLNE," About the gamma squeeze on CLNE:

In order for it to happen on Friday the price must be over $13 but also the MMs would have had to sold *naked* calls. I don't think that is the case, the MM buys the stock as soon as you buy calls, the amount of stock they buy depends on the price of stock from the target price and also expiring date. I am sure they have algos that calculate how much of stock they need to buy depending on the variables. And this should create a feedback loop - gamma squeeze.

So the gamma squeeze should look as a constant slow rise (TSLA) instead of the boom (GME) we had when the short squeeze happens. 

Also, when mentioning GME we had people here saying the gamma squeeze will happen if the stock finishes above $300 on that Friday, Jan 29th. Well it did, it finished on $325 that Friday and guess what, it opened $275 next Monday. I got burned that day.

Nevertheless I hold 1,500 of CLNE and will continue to hold, my price target is above $20. And now I will look at the price at open.",an_idea_of_an_entity,41,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o11bgv/daily_popular_tickers_thread_for_june_16_2021_amc/h1yshwj/,0.0,0.958,0.042,0.8047
933,GME," About the gamma squeeze on CLNE:

In order for it to happen on Friday the price must be over $13 but also the MMs would have had to sold *naked* calls. I don't think that is the case, the MM buys the stock as soon as you buy calls, the amount of stock they buy depends on the price of stock from the target price and also expiring date. I am sure they have algos that calculate how much of stock they need to buy depending on the variables. And this should create a feedback loop - gamma squeeze.

So the gamma squeeze should look as a constant slow rise (TSLA) instead of the boom (GME) we had when the short squeeze happens. 

Also, when mentioning GME we had people here saying the gamma squeeze will happen if the stock finishes above $300 on that Friday, Jan 29th. Well it did, it finished on $325 that Friday and guess what, it opened $275 next Monday. I got burned that day.

1386,AMC," A few counter points for you to consider:

1) [https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekly/](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekly/) check the weekly domestic box office. Maybe 25% of this ends up as AMC's profit. Compare 2021 with 2019 and keep in mind during 2019 AMC still lost money. Now they've got big debt payments to go along with their normal expenses. 

2) Cost to borrow AMC shares for shorting has dropped dramatically the last couple of weeks. It's under 3% currently. Also many shorters averaged up their cost basis with the recent price run up so there is much less pressure for them to panic close their positions than there was a week or two ago. Never forget it's only profit when you sell and it's only a loss when they buy to cover.

3) The run up in price has been driven by the very high volume, almost double it's average. That same volume which triggers retail to drive up the price also gives short sellers with lower cost basis (e.g. more underwater) easy ways out of their jamb. The sharp movements also allow them to sell puts against their shorts to profit that way.

4) The problem with AMC's expansion plan in LA is the industry just isn't as profitable as it used to be or those ""premier"" theaters with hefty rent payments would not be for sale. They should be using the money they were gifted by retail shareholders to pay down and reorganize their debt, close lower performing screens, and shrink their way back in to a profitable business model.",terrybmw335,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o163hb/a_bulls_case_for_amc/h20cnae/,0.101,0.835,0.064,-0.8164

1652,LPG," Here's some words of wisdom from a country that has had a lot of LPG (natural gas) powered vehicles and have seemingly given up despite being one of the biggest exporters of gas in the world.

Australia has had a lot of government incentives to keep LPG powered vehicles on the road, even encouraging local car makers to make LPG versions of their popular sedans (until they pulled out of the country entirely).

For a while state governments even had rebates to convert existing cars to LPG and this kept a cottage industry of converting shops alive until the subsidies ran out.

And whilst for a while, every taxi was running on LPG. As soon as local manufacturing of cars exited. So did the glut of LPG powered taxis. Taxi firms quickly switched to petrol(gasoline/electric) hybrids instead.

So basically without strong government subsidies, LPG is going to die a slow death here. It doesn't matter if it's cheaper and cleaner to run than petrol because hybrids and full electrics exist.

Also despite the Australian government pouring billions into the gas industry, Oil/Gas will be a stranded asset when energy storage technologies mature in ten years. Renewable hydrogen is the only way out for the gas industry. But they still struggle to make natural gas sourced hydrogen viable vs EVs anyway.

The only way California, with it's strict air pollution regulations, will suddenly have an uptick in LPG powered vehicles is with massive government subsidies to pay entirely for LPG (or dual fuel) conversions of existing vehicles. This would also mean government paying for fueling infrastructure as well.

Basically the window for natural gas to boom is rapidly closing and will not be remotely profitable without massive government subsidies. Is it possible? Sure, governments have been giving the oil/gas industry a free ride for over a century. But when will economics catch up and voters demand better value for taxpayers dollars?

About lab-grown meat, of course, it will have a dramatic impact, but I suspect that its first adoption will be for animal food, not for a human one.

The race to reduce emission has started and it does make sense to build a RNG plant with an expected lifetime of 20+ years. If this is not enough and consumers will prefer lab grown steaks, probably other efforts will be needed by farmers in terms of water consumption etc.

1662,LPG," Gas conversion rebates start early 90s ended in 2014.
Car manufacturing ended 2017. You can still get LPG at the pump. But those are slowly disappearing. 

Australia's environmental record is currently horrendous. 
Massive land clearing plus forest fires have devastated areas bigger than some European countries. Current federal government thinks coal/gas save us... well actually just it's donors... 

My state of Victoria is still recovering from a massive winter storm, many areas are expected not to have power for weeks. Given the current situation here I see energy storage and decentralised power generation having a strong future.
I've got a friend raising a new born in winter without electricity. They are lucky they have a wood fired heater. 

BioMethane is a very viable alternative, heck i reckon it's better than hydrogen, but not when current fossil fuel industry gets subsidised to a stupid amount. Bio gas doesn't have the billions in infrastructure the fossil fuel equivalent gets gifted to them by governments. 

But again look at a lot of developing countries being able to turn newly built sewage/septic tanks into bio gas capture for cooking/heating.  Solving sanitation and fuel problems simultaneously.

By 2025 it will be commercially available, but the quality and flavor needed for large-scale human consumption will require much more time.

That is why its first adoption will be in animal feedstocks (chickens, fish, pigs etc) and will improve the quality of the final traditional meat. Already this will be a game-changer for humanity.

Today's comparison between dairy farms and lab grown meat in terms of energy uses does not include the case of dramatic improvements for farmers too. From a political point of view, no candidate can afford the collapse of the dairy sector, huge incentives will exist in order to help farmers in reducing their environmental impact.

1744,WKHS," Let's honestly look at this from an objective perspective:

1) What is the legal basis for the challenge? Workhorse lost a contract. USPS is a corporation that has no obligation to award to Workhorse. Even under the assumption of possible impropriety by DeJoy, Workhorse has no guarantee or reason to be awarded the contract, even in the rare event that the legal challenge somehow voided the contract (which is not likely). There is no legal standing for this helping Workhorse. It could fuck Oshkosh, but nothing about this helps Workhorse. 

2) Legal fees. WKHS does not have the liquidity to fight this in the courts. If the USPS even remotely attempts to defend themselves, which they will, WKHS runs the risk of millions in legal fees that they can scarcely afford. They're already struggling with funding and production and they have a 2.0 Debt ratio. They are swimming in debt and have no product. 

3) If history is any indication, the USPS doesn't like emerging technology and wants something reliable and known. Whomever takes over should this cause DeJoy's firing is immensely unlikely to reward this move. Oshkosh's platform, which is a joint venture with Ford, can be fully electric, but also is based on the existing Transit van platform. There are severe limits to the deployment of electric trucks in rural areas due to infrastructure that just isn't there. USPS is a risk averse business and won't award WKHS.

I *will* place long puts on this stock if it spikes. WKHS has no chance of this lawsuit being successful.

1750,WKHS," None of this voids the contract awarding. USPS is a corporation that has no obligation to award WKHS anything.

DeJoy could get screwed. Oshkosh could have the contract pulled (extremely unlikely). But none of this awards WKHS shit and they will have tremendous legal fees incurred to fight this.

Ultimately, WKHS's platform has to be proven. Since this is not an apples-to-apples bid, they can have any number of additional requirements placed on them by USPS to ensure that the 10-year process is feasible. These are requirements Oshkosh doesn't have to meet due to the nature of the varying platforms.

I am not seeing anything that supports WKHS standing a chance in this case. I'll be surprised if it isn't thrown out by fall.",TheMammoth731,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o18j42/exclusive_workhorse_to_challenge_usps_decision_to/h1zqorf/,0.084,0.752,0.165,0.8641
1751,ANY," Yeah, this statement is that they're entitled to sue and the US can't dismiss it just because they're suing the US. Read your own quote. Literally nothing says that there is a legal wrong in awarding the contract elsewhere. They have to prove that there was an illegal action taken during the bid process directly related to the bid evaluation *THAT LED TO THE CONTRACT BEING AWARDED*. That is a monumental task. Not only is DeJoy's possible insider trading not relevant (considering the award was almost guaranteed as a board decision), but it doesn't change anything about the contract's awarding. Even if they prove it, the decision to award the contract would almost assuredly still stand. 

Secondly, while it is a part of the Executive branch, it is an independent ""corporation"" within the US government (thank your republican members of senate). This means the contract was almost assuredly a BOARD DECISION. Even government contracts have no obligation to award WKHS or anyone else and ANY non-apples to apples bid can be scrutinized under the bid process. I have literally done dozens of government bids.

A long term hold with a TINY float that could run 1000's of %. No, this isn't an attempt to pump, it doesn't need that cause it's a long term hold. Besides, with only a 2.5 million float that would moon this to $100 in probably a day or two lol. Check out this news!!! Based out of Miami! ALF

1873,ASO," I have some shares. I think the dip today is also an over reaction to the retail sales report that came out showing a drop in sales. This drop was driven primarily by cars because there weren't any cars to sell (chip shortage). The rest of the retail industry that did have stuff to sell did well, and ASO was part of that.

Also, they did an investor conference today. Take a look at their stats on revenue per square foot compared to their competition...it's WAY better. [https://investors.academy.com/static-files/0a7e3a55-43c9-49d8-9af4-8d1b40460222](https://investors.academy.com/static-files/0a7e3a55-43c9-49d8-9af4-8d1b40460222) (slide 26; over $300 per square foot compared to Dicks at $228. We don't have the bass pro number here as they are private and probably don't publish that number; it may be more competitive.)

I've been impressed with ASO. They have tons of runway for expansion, low debt, and are smashing their numbers. Really can't complain about them right now. As for the other bonus at the end...we were at the $40 mark earlier this week until today's drop. Not entirely sure that will come to fruition, but I won't complain if it does...lol",wcrisler,8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0udtf/now_that_shit_has_somewhat_calmed_down_here_lets/h1xfxoq/,0.05,0.862,0.087,0.7129

2179,DNMR, Thanks for the comment. I agree on all points. I think the fed will taper too late and to low and inflation will happen. A penny for your thoughts on how much inflation we'll see in say in 2025? I think a lot of the  correction in growth has already been built into the prices due to expectations of the bond yields future behavior. DNMR is a quintessential example of growth. Fell from $64  Feb 11 to $15.7  May 12 or  -75% in 90 days due to stimulus bills being passed. Consider what kind of inflation would be warrent such a drop. Suppose all DNMRs returns on $x occurred in 2031. Before stimulus inflation is 2% so those return might be $x/1.02^10=0.82*$x. In order to find an inflation that would justify -75% price drop: 0.25*0.82*$x=$x/i^10 i=1.17 or a 17% inflation rate over the next 10 years. That seems a bit high to me. Admittedly it got up to 13% in 1988 but didn't stay there for 10 years. TLDR I think inflation expectations are already built into growth stock prices.,skellis,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0u7ub/guide_for_tomorrow_aftermath_of_fed_announcement/h1z6ujx/,0.026,0.913,0.06,0.7227
2180,JP," ""Transitory""...no one in history has ever used the term until a couple months ago. It's a meaningless word...2 months is transitory...20 yrs is transitory. When the financial guys are playing political tactics with nonsensical words, that always scares me. CPI was awful and markets went high...PPI was worse and markets went higher before finally pausing a bit. PPI flows down to CPI over 1-3 months. So it's a slam dunk that CPI is much much worse the next 3 months and longer if PPI continue worse (all indications are it is accelerating). JP is already on the proverbial slippery slope and I'm not sure he could stop it now even if he made a dramatic move today.

Consequently, it could force some shorts to cover, which can spark an epic squeeze.  


Of course, there needs to be a lot of demand and volume for this to happen. So we'll see what happens. I'm long calls in GOEV.",mainst_bets,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o12erl/goev_popped_up_yesterday_17_so_whats_happend/h1yxoi9/,0.045,0.843,0.112,0.5971

2296,ITUB," The Brazilian onshore version of these shares has been cheap. If you look at them (ITUB4 on the BVMF) they're starting to break out to the upside. Also, the ITUB that we're trading has some foreign exchange exposure, and the USDBRL exchange rate is breaking down through the important 5.000 level.   


So if we can get a breakout to the downside in USDBRL and a breakout in the upside for ITUB4, it's like rocket fuel for ITUB.",black_hoodie_rap,13,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o19rj1/itub_16july_8_c_yolo/h1znqcx/,0.025,0.893,0.082,0.5423
