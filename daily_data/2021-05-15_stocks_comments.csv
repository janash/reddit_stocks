8,LL," Similar here in WA state 

My LL sold our home of 4 years. Been paying 1350. 

Was hunting for a new rental and every place was getting scooped up fast... I mean fast! Our home sold in 4 or 5 days.... currently in the process of moving. Secured a lease for a shit house that's about 40% smaller, no garage  or any of the cool stuff we have at our current location. And about 500$ more per month.

Every rental had 40+ pending applications. We lucked out and got this place, however, I feel this new LL will be a fun one to deal with. Potential mold problem is a big issue. The Grouting on back splashes are all crumbled and exposing the inside of the walls, bathrooms both have failing caulking on and around the bath tubs. One spot has a 4 cm by 1cm hole into the wall, exposed drywall near the vent.

During the walk through I made notice of these concerns.

Also the place was dirty... cob webs everywhere, can see mudslides through the paint, the hood is over the stove is nasty and filled with grease, blinds are dusty and gross, strong evidence of indoor smoking.

I've also taken video and pics of all of the potential health issues. After 3 weeks I finally heard from maintenance,  who simply said, ""let's meet next week, have a good weekend"". After emailing 3 times about these issues.

Nearly every corner where the ceiling meets the walls are cracked, can see the mud tape in many spots, it's just shit.

I have a feeling I'll eventually be able to break this lease legally w/o repercussion. 

This is going to be a fun year.",stupidpunname54,6,/r/stocks/comments/ncw45t/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/gy7ztj7/,0.087,0.833,0.08,-0.4926

2. Self driving. I don't know where the races are here. Lots of companies doing stuff. I know NIO are doing stuff. Someone bought Ubers? Data recently?    
Self driving is the future. Self driving taxis and trucks is a crazy proposition for profitability in the future. 24 hours of activity for the car or truck (less a few hours for charging).

Don’t get too excited about controlling VW thru Porsche SE. The shares of P SE are evenly split between Stammaktien and Vorzugsaktien and the ones listed are the VZ‘s. The Stammaktien are all in the hands of the Porsche and Piëch family. Hence, they own 16.7% of Volkswagen but have the majority votes. 

Vorzugsaktien have a higher dividend as Stammaktien €2.21 versus €2.204 in 2020 for Porsche and €4.86 vs €4.80 for VW

Other than that it's not possible to stop for 30 min or 1 hour to charge the battery up to 50% then continue the trip.. please correct me if I'm wrong.

61,ICE," So basically most users will do regular city/suburbs drives during the day and charge overnight using their home's/apartment's electricity source. and I totally see that.

In my view however, one benefit of owning an expensive asset such as a motor vehicle is to be reliable and able to transport you anywhere anytime. If i have to hop into my car in the middle of the night and drive because of some unforseen emergency can the EV help me? I know it's one of those rare examples but they are valid concerns for any user and simply an area where ICE still wins. It almost seems like people will need to have a back-up ICE and that EV can't be your only car just yet.

64,GM," That's a really good point. I personally feel like there's a division in Tesla investors. On the one hand you've got the people that just want to see Tesla shit on the other automakers and don't really care so much about their mission, but more about their status and stock price. On the other hand you've got the people that support Tesla's mission and would love to see competitors help accelerate the transition to sustainable energy, but are disappointed by the legacy automakers' lack of devotion to EVs.

Personally I'm in the second camp, where I'm just dumbfounded and quite honestly frustrated every time I hear a company like BWM or Toyota say that hybrids are the future, or a GM or Ford announce a product to come out 3 years from now with specs that are already pretty bad today at a totally uncompetitive price (I'm looking at you electric Hummer).

VW is one of the exceptions in my opinion, together with Hyundai, Volvo/Polestar and maybe one or two others that are actually trying. Even though their cars still have serious problems (especially VW's), I agree people - including Tesla shareholders - should be commending and encouraging them to push the adoption of EVs.

66,ICE," Here's the low down.  


A)   


Actually, at least on my Model 3, charging up to around 70% is relatively fast. Here's Teslabjörn running a hands on test:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWkyXApmOpQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWkyXApmOpQ)

What this means is that you'll charge from around 10% to around 70% in give or take 12-15 minutes. On a Model 3 LR that means roughly 200km range if you have a lead foot like me (\~200wh/km). It means you'll probably stop every 1.5-2 hours. You get much farther on a charge with more reasonable speed (100-110km/h) but Sheepherder don't play like that.  


Most people who get an EV will charge at home, and if you are like me with a fair commute (120km return) you'll use about 30% of your battery on that trip and you'll want to charge nightly. This means that the 95-98% of the time when you aren't doing a road trip you'll never really think about your battery. Plugging in becomes as normal as washing your hands after you take a shit. (As in some people don't, but you really should.)  


B) 

As you can now see, the 30-60 minute stops you're afraid of aren't going to be necessary unless you want to. Ahead of any long trip you'll charge to 90 or 100% depending on how nervous you are about battery degradation, and that will get you around 300km which is way longer than a lot of people will want to drive without a stop.

I've only done one long road trip so far (two days 1500km) but what I can say is it felt very natural to make those frequent stops and the drive was less taxing than it would've normally been.  


At no point did I worry I wouldn't reach a charger in time, and while I spent maybe at a guess 90-120 minutes on charging, much of that time would've been spent on leg stretchers or food breaks in an ICE car anyway. On the morning of the second day for instance I got up a bit early and charged the car while the rest of the group was having breakfast.

In conclusion, what you're worried about is what everyone is worried about before they start really looking at the reality of EV, but once you're past the hurdle of that worry you'll find that you didn't need to worry. 

No, you will not feel a need to charge to full in 5 minutes. I promise you.

No, you will not feel a need to have a thousand miles in the battery. You can take that to the bank.

Will you \*want\* to charge to full in 5 and have a thousand miles in your battery? Absolutely! I'd love to. But the reality is that while charging may be quicker, what is likely to happen is that batteries become cheaper and most people won't want to pay for thousand-mile batteries even when they become available. Knowing what I know now, I would absolutely not want to pay €30 000 more for twice the range, and frankly maybe not even €10k more. The 550-odd WLTP of the Model 3 LR is more than enough.

The real problem right now is not range, it's cost. Additionally, for Scandinavians, it's the lack of towing capability. Both of these issues will be fixed within the next few years. Prices are already dropping and towing capability is increasing.

That said, as you can see from Norwegian and Swedish sales numbers, even with these real hurdles, adoption is coming and as you can see from Norway it's a real snow-ball effect. Anyone buying an ICE-car in Norway today is going to regret it very shortly.

At the end of the day, nothing I've said thus far can really persuade you if you're certain that I'm wrong, but everything can be easily verified by simply taking a rental out on your own.

If you don't believe me, try it and come tell me how wrong I am afterwards. I would advice you start with a test drive of a Model 3. Just be careful with the accelleration. It kicks like a rollercoaster.

Once you've done that, if you're still itching to prove me wrong, rent one for a week and go on a trip with it. I promise you that if you do it with an open mind you'll absolutely find your worries are completely unfounded.

That is to say as long as you live somewhere with super chargers. If you don't, I can certainly understand the hesitation!",Proper-Sheepherder-8,3,/r/stocks/comments/nczgcr/volkswagen_is_totally_killing_it_right_now/gy94arl/,0.108,0.826,0.067,-0.9882
67,ICE," True, there are definitely downsides to EVs and even though they may only apply to rare scenarios, they definitely should be considered. That said, I think people are too focused on the downsides of EVs while ignoring the downsides of ICE vehicles because we are used to them.

For example, let's imagine we would've been using EVs all this time and suddenly we had to switch to using ICE cars for some reason. Everyone would be complaining how they had to stop at a fuel station every couple hundred miles, how they had to replace their brakes 10x faster, or how often they had to replace this new clutch thing,  how complex the engine was with its thousands of extra moving parts and all the reliability issues that come with that, how air quality would be getting worse, how expensive the refuelling is, how noisy they are, how uncomfortable the driving with gears and no instant torque is, I could keep going for a while.

Even taking your example, if you suddenly had to hop into your car in the middle of the night and drive because of some unforeseen emergency, you could find yourself to be nearly out of gas and have to take a detour just to refuel your car. Whereas with an EV unless it would happen within 30-60 min from you coming home after a day where you drove 400 miles, it would probably already be sufficiently charged.",Ehralur,1,/r/stocks/comments/nczgcr/volkswagen_is_totally_killing_it_right_now/gy917zo/,0.081,0.876,0.042,-0.7845

They produced 500k cars last year and they are on track to increase their production by 50% this year (there is even some speculation that they are aiming for 1 million cars this year). Also, they usually talk about their long term goals (like their goal of producing 20M cars in 2030) and not their quarter to quarter perfomance. We'll just have to wait a couple years and see.

121,BJ," Very sorry about your loss. This pandemic has taken too much away from us. 

I don't know the fraction of your portfolio you intend to apply here, but if it's anything more than a few percent I'd just chuck it into a market fund and call it a day. If you're asking us, you probably shouldn't be touching individual stocks. Don't listen to us maniacs.

But... If I had to choose a single company with growth in mind and personal conviction, I'd probably put it in BJ, which I am long on. Now obviously, in this case, it's not growth if you define that as having a tech element. However, this company has four key attributes that, I believe, set it up like a growth company in the 10-year horizon:

1. A small market capitalization with about 1/4 Costco's market share in stores, 1/10 Costco's bottom-line, and 1/30 Costco's market cap. 

2. A holding company's management that hammers in the motive to expand into new territory (growth) and facilitate online shopping and curbside pickup.

3. A top-heavy, speculative total capitalization structure (i.e., they have a lot of longterm debt). This means as far as investments go, it is risky. They have to pay interest on the debt and that eats into their operating margins, which eats into metrics like EPS. This can actually be a *good* thing, because expenses on these debts are relatively static while operating profits are variable. If they make 1 million this year, owe 500k in interest, then 500k goes to the shares. If the next year they make 1.5 million, they may still owe 500k in interest, but now 1 million goes to the shares. A 50% increase in operating profit, but 100% increase in earnings for common. The fear, obviously, is that they fail to meet obligations and default on their loans. Thus far, they've done well in keeping up payments, and they regularly turn a profit. Still, high risk, especially with interest rates expected to rise soon.

4. Secondary issue nature due to regionality. Growth onto the national scale in, say, 10 years would likely be coincident with a three-fold increase in outlets and, presuming profitability holds, at least a three-fold increase in market capitalization. National-scale recognition could magnify this. Note that the debt in point 3 supports the managements' notions as to expansion.

A final note: I would hesitate buying it at this instant. It has had a strong run-up since last earnings, and the next QR is next week. Price is near alltime high and valuations are touching a little too high IMO. Projections are for EPS shrinkage due to people coming out of pandemic isolation, which could drop the price. Further, their CEO recently died unexpectedly, which throws a wrench in things. And finally, I think there is the potential for a market correction in the coming months. If that happens, the price could plummet. It fell almost 7% earlier this week when we had that inflation selloff. 

Still, just put it in a market fund, bit by bit, over time. For all my ramblings I'm an idiot in the end. Like a casino, the house (market) always wins. Good luck.",Peshhhh,2,/r/stocks/comments/ncutxn/growth_stocks_for_the_next_10_years/gy8m6wq/,0.076,0.755,0.169,0.9955

But... If I had to choose a single company with growth in mind and personal conviction, I'd probably put it in BJ, which I am long on. Now obviously, in this case, it's not growth if you define that as having a tech element. However, this company has four key attributes that, I believe, set it up like a growth company in the 10-year horizon:

1. A small market capitalization with about 1/4 Costco's market share in stores, 1/10 Costco's bottom-line, and 1/30 Costco's market cap. 

2. A holding company's management that hammers in the motive to expand into new territory (growth) and facilitate online shopping and curbside pickup.

3. A top-heavy, speculative total capitalization structure (i.e., they have a lot of longterm debt). This means as far as investments go, it is risky. They have to pay interest on the debt and that eats into their operating margins, which eats into metrics like EPS. This can actually be a *good* thing, because expenses on these debts are relatively static while operating profits are variable. If they make 1 million this year, owe 500k in interest, then 500k goes to the shares. If the next year they make 1.5 million, they may still owe 500k in interest, but now 1 million goes to the shares. A 50% increase in operating profit, but 100% increase in earnings for common. The fear, obviously, is that they fail to meet obligations and default on their loans. Thus far, they've done well in keeping up payments, and they regularly turn a profit. Still, high risk, especially with interest rates expected to rise soon.

4. Secondary issue nature due to regionality. Growth onto the national scale in, say, 10 years would likely be coincident with a three-fold increase in outlets and, presuming profitability holds, at least a three-fold increase in market capitalization. National-scale recognition could magnify this. Note that the debt in point 3 supports the managements' notions as to expansion.

A final note: I would hesitate buying it at this instant. It has had a strong run-up since last earnings, and the next QR is next week. Price is near alltime high and valuations are touching a little too high IMO. Projections are for EPS shrinkage due to people coming out of pandemic isolation, which could drop the price. Further, their CEO recently died unexpectedly, which throws a wrench in things. And finally, I think there is the potential for a market correction in the coming months. If that happens, the price could plummet. It fell almost 7% earlier this week when we had that inflation selloff. 

Still, just put it in a market fund, bit by bit, over time. For all my ramblings I'm an idiot in the end. Like a casino, the house (market) always wins. Good luck.",Peshhhh,2,/r/stocks/comments/ncutxn/growth_stocks_for_the_next_10_years/gy8m6wq/,0.076,0.755,0.169,0.9955

YouTube TV for example it is impossible to skip ads but yet Google continues to allow the ad blocking with YouTube.

Google owns K12 and have not done anything yet to really monetize.

Another great example with Google is Android.  Google continues to offer for free even though there is basically no competition.

So Google could easily add a couple dollar license fee and have a couple of billion in new revenue with basically no expense.

Google is starting to monetize one of their assets starting next month with Google Photos.    Been giving unlimited for free and now will start charging.

So that removes a multi billion dollar expense and will now be adding new cloud revenue.

Google has really been just growing so fast they just have not really need to focus on better monetizing the assets they have.   Last quarter Google for example increased profits by well over 100% YoY.

207,AMAT," Reading other comments - I won’t comment on the valuation since different folks might have different risk tolerances. I am invested in AMD via bullish LEAP Puts. But I want to respond on some of the other technology or business related comments since that is my background. I have worked with both Intel and AMD as their partner as well as their competitor. They both have their strength and weakness. 

Intel biggest weakness currently is the fact that they own fabs that they need to keep busy. It is not easy for Intel to support third party usage of their fabs like for example competing with TSMC. Leading edge designs require lots of support from the fab to the chip designer in terms of libraries, models, tools etc. this is a multi year process and most designs of chips using leading edge processes are locked in around 4 years before MP. There is a lot that goes into decisions around wafer pricing, mask sets etc that makes it very difficult to move fabs once you are locked in. Some fabless design companies do try to accommodate multiple fabs but usually sacrifice either power, or die size or performance in order to do so. 

Hence a leading edge CPU design like Zen4 won’t move fabs once the design is kicked off. This is usually a 3 to 4 year cycle from architecture study to first mass production. 

Intel is just starting to move in the direction of offering third parties to use their fabs. So getting to a point of being competitive to TSMC is probably 2 to 3 years away best case. Which means they need to keep their own chips flooding their fabs in order to amortize the capex. This limits how much they can take risks to compete with AMD or NVDA or for that matter Apple. So is Intel a threat to AMD - for sure yes. But will they blow AMD away anytime soon - no chance in hell. 

Also the rest of the industry - Google, AMZN, MSFT, Dell, HP, BABA, Baidu, Tencent, Sony etc definitely want AMD to keep going strong since they never liked to be single sourced to Intel. Intel had monopoly pricing for the longest time and they squeezed most of the ODMs very hard. 

As I mentioned before - AMD has been in this position before with the Opteron. And they blew the lead and dropped the ball on execution and gave up everything back to Intel. This is one of the main reasons now you have seen designs like Graviton emerge. But the current AMD team is much stronger and different from the one that blew up before. And so history repeating itself is low probability. But if that happens I believe the biggest beneficiary will be ARM and not Intel. 

Is NV a threat - perhaps yes - but again only on the margins for now. x64 still has too much of a software development advantage to be unseated by ARM in the general compute space. And NV historically has had limited success in moving their ARM CPU designs to the high performance arena. If the ARM acquisition goes through they will be more competitive but there is a significant portion of the server space - both cloud and on-premise that will stay x64 at least for the next decade. 

Now regarding issues on materials, crypto etc - there seems to be a misunderstanding. Crypto will keep moving to ASIC more and more. And as the pressure for power consumption becomes more critical for crypto success, the GPU will become less important. At least the GPU that is non compute and that drives a display. GPUs that are used for compute like for ML will become more important and any slack or drop in demand from crypto for GPUs will be more than compensated by the increase in demand for ML in the cloud. 

And regarding raw materials - the semiconductor supply chain is very complex. Most of the materials come from Japan, Korea, Taiwan and very little actually comes from China and the US. Especially in the leading edge nodes. Fabs are just one small portion of the equation. Things like substrates are critical and this was shown by the Fukushima disaster which bought the semiconductor industry to a standstill. So fears of moving materials back from China to US and hence giving Intel or others who have fabs an advantage is not true. Even Intel is dependent of companies like SPIL or AMAT or ASE or Nanya etc. Being fabless has become an advantage in the semiconductor space now compared to 20 years ago when Intel’s fab tech was head and shoulders above the rest of the industry. Having flexibility in targeting process nodes have given companies like AVGO, MRVL and NV huge advantages and have hampered Intel in expanding their footprint. For example Intel tried and failed to gain much in the networking space or the 5G space and it is still TBD it they will succeed in GPU and ML compute. They have killed many products in this space over the past 5 years. 

Full disclosure - I am long AMD, NV, ASML, AMAT, STM, ON and was short Intel before but now neutral on them.",narensankar,13,/r/stocks/comments/ncyqua/risks_regarding_amd/gy82xj9/,0.096,0.763,0.141,0.991

Also the rest of the industry - Google, AMZN, MSFT, Dell, HP, BABA, Baidu, Tencent, Sony etc definitely want AMD to keep going strong since they never liked to be single sourced to Intel. Intel had monopoly pricing for the longest time and they squeezed most of the ODMs very hard. 

As I mentioned before - AMD has been in this position before with the Opteron. And they blew the lead and dropped the ball on execution and gave up everything back to Intel. This is one of the main reasons now you have seen designs like Graviton emerge. But the current AMD team is much stronger and different from the one that blew up before. And so history repeating itself is low probability. But if that happens I believe the biggest beneficiary will be ARM and not Intel. 

Is NV a threat - perhaps yes - but again only on the margins for now. x64 still has too much of a software development advantage to be unseated by ARM in the general compute space. And NV historically has had limited success in moving their ARM CPU designs to the high performance arena. If the ARM acquisition goes through they will be more competitive but there is a significant portion of the server space - both cloud and on-premise that will stay x64 at least for the next decade. 

Now regarding issues on materials, crypto etc - there seems to be a misunderstanding. Crypto will keep moving to ASIC more and more. And as the pressure for power consumption becomes more critical for crypto success, the GPU will become less important. At least the GPU that is non compute and that drives a display. GPUs that are used for compute like for ML will become more important and any slack or drop in demand from crypto for GPUs will be more than compensated by the increase in demand for ML in the cloud. 

And regarding raw materials - the semiconductor supply chain is very complex. Most of the materials come from Japan, Korea, Taiwan and very little actually comes from China and the US. Especially in the leading edge nodes. Fabs are just one small portion of the equation. Things like substrates are critical and this was shown by the Fukushima disaster which bought the semiconductor industry to a standstill. So fears of moving materials back from China to US and hence giving Intel or others who have fabs an advantage is not true. Even Intel is dependent of companies like SPIL or AMAT or ASE or Nanya etc. Being fabless has become an advantage in the semiconductor space now compared to 20 years ago when Intel’s fab tech was head and shoulders above the rest of the industry. Having flexibility in targeting process nodes have given companies like AVGO, MRVL and NV huge advantages and have hampered Intel in expanding their footprint. For example Intel tried and failed to gain much in the networking space or the 5G space and it is still TBD it they will succeed in GPU and ML compute. They have killed many products in this space over the past 5 years.

209,AMZN," Reading other comments - I won’t comment on the valuation since different folks might have different risk tolerances. I am invested in AMD via bullish LEAP Puts. But I want to respond on some of the other technology or business related comments since that is my background. I have worked with both Intel and AMD as their partner as well as their competitor. They both have their strength and weakness. 

Intel biggest weakness currently is the fact that they own fabs that they need to keep busy. It is not easy for Intel to support third party usage of their fabs like for example competing with TSMC. Leading edge designs require lots of support from the fab to the chip designer in terms of libraries, models, tools etc. this is a multi year process and most designs of chips using leading edge processes are locked in around 4 years before MP. There is a lot that goes into decisions around wafer pricing, mask sets etc that makes it very difficult to move fabs once you are locked in. Some fabless design companies do try to accommodate multiple fabs but usually sacrifice either power, or die size or performance in order to do so. 

Hence a leading edge CPU design like Zen4 won’t move fabs once the design is kicked off. This is usually a 3 to 4 year cycle from architecture study to first mass production. 

Intel is just starting to move in the direction of offering third parties to use their fabs. So getting to a point of being competitive to TSMC is probably 2 to 3 years away best case. Which means they need to keep their own chips flooding their fabs in order to amortize the capex. This limits how much they can take risks to compete with AMD or NVDA or for that matter Apple. So is Intel a threat to AMD - for sure yes. But will they blow AMD away anytime soon - no chance in hell.

Is NV a threat - perhaps yes - but again only on the margins for now. x64 still has too much of a software development advantage to be unseated by ARM in the general compute space. And NV historically has had limited success in moving their ARM CPU designs to the high performance arena. If the ARM acquisition goes through they will be more competitive but there is a significant portion of the server space - both cloud and on-premise that will stay x64 at least for the next decade. 

Now regarding issues on materials, crypto etc - there seems to be a misunderstanding. Crypto will keep moving to ASIC more and more. And as the pressure for power consumption becomes more critical for crypto success, the GPU will become less important. At least the GPU that is non compute and that drives a display. GPUs that are used for compute like for ML will become more important and any slack or drop in demand from crypto for GPUs will be more than compensated by the increase in demand for ML in the cloud. 

And regarding raw materials - the semiconductor supply chain is very complex. Most of the materials come from Japan, Korea, Taiwan and very little actually comes from China and the US. Especially in the leading edge nodes. Fabs are just one small portion of the equation. Things like substrates are critical and this was shown by the Fukushima disaster which bought the semiconductor industry to a standstill. So fears of moving materials back from China to US and hence giving Intel or others who have fabs an advantage is not true. Even Intel is dependent of companies like SPIL or AMAT or ASE or Nanya etc. Being fabless has become an advantage in the semiconductor space now compared to 20 years ago when Intel’s fab tech was head and shoulders above the rest of the industry. Having flexibility in targeting process nodes have given companies like AVGO, MRVL and NV huge advantages and have hampered Intel in expanding their footprint. For example Intel tried and failed to gain much in the networking space or the 5G space and it is still TBD it they will succeed in GPU and ML compute. They have killed many products in this space over the past 5 years.

216,MRVL," Reading other comments - I won’t comment on the valuation since different folks might have different risk tolerances. I am invested in AMD via bullish LEAP Puts. But I want to respond on some of the other technology or business related comments since that is my background. I have worked with both Intel and AMD as their partner as well as their competitor. They both have their strength and weakness. 

Intel biggest weakness currently is the fact that they own fabs that they need to keep busy. It is not easy for Intel to support third party usage of their fabs like for example competing with TSMC. Leading edge designs require lots of support from the fab to the chip designer in terms of libraries, models, tools etc. this is a multi year process and most designs of chips using leading edge processes are locked in around 4 years before MP. There is a lot that goes into decisions around wafer pricing, mask sets etc that makes it very difficult to move fabs once you are locked in. Some fabless design companies do try to accommodate multiple fabs but usually sacrifice either power, or die size or performance in order to do so. 

Hence a leading edge CPU design like Zen4 won’t move fabs once the design is kicked off. This is usually a 3 to 4 year cycle from architecture study to first mass production. 

Intel is just starting to move in the direction of offering third parties to use their fabs. So getting to a point of being competitive to TSMC is probably 2 to 3 years away best case. Which means they need to keep their own chips flooding their fabs in order to amortize the capex. This limits how much they can take risks to compete with AMD or NVDA or for that matter Apple. So is Intel a threat to AMD - for sure yes. But will they blow AMD away anytime soon - no chance in hell. 

Also the rest of the industry - Google, AMZN, MSFT, Dell, HP, BABA, Baidu, Tencent, Sony etc definitely want AMD to keep going strong since they never liked to be single sourced to Intel. Intel had monopoly pricing for the longest time and they squeezed most of the ODMs very hard. 

As I mentioned before - AMD has been in this position before with the Opteron. And they blew the lead and dropped the ball on execution and gave up everything back to Intel. This is one of the main reasons now you have seen designs like Graviton emerge. But the current AMD team is much stronger and different from the one that blew up before. And so history repeating itself is low probability. But if that happens I believe the biggest beneficiary will be ARM and not Intel.

First off, before the mining boom a couple years ago, everybody was moving to PC gaming because it was cheaper than consoles and had better graphics. There weren’t any price wars (aside from Nvidia dropping), just AMD pricing their performance comparable to Nvidia. People use GPUs for everything and still will now with artificial intelligence and gpu rendering for movies and whatnot. People will be happy to finally get cards MSRP. AMD is currently benefiting either way because of scalpers and people will continue to scalp consoles even if they can’t scalp gpus. When AMD/Nvidia start meeting true demand, scalpers started returning cards so people could upgrade their PCs and build clusters.

The nature of mining and crypto is mostly about decentralization, once gamers get their cards and possibly start dabbling in mining, the coins they mine will increase in value. My guess would be a perpetual boom bust for scalpers, but no change in revenue for anyone.",Krypto_Doggg,1,/r/stocks/comments/ncyqua/risks_regarding_amd/gy851hj/,0.037,0.896,0.067,0.5023
235,AMD," Intel has about an 80% market share on the larger micro-processor market and AMD is barely breaking 10% market share and is rapidly growing. (admittedly, this might be semi-dated info)

Yes, a few key large players are designing their own microprocessors for the first time, but they aren't looking to capture the whole market as much as they are to supply their high-end devices under their brand only with limited hardware their brand uses.

This will be a larger issue for Intel, because it isn't cutting into AMD's share of the market, it is cutting into Intel's current market share.

The reason I'm not too concerned with these risks is because I see AMD has ample room to gain market share from Intel. Even if the Intel + AMD market share drops overall, there is still ample room for AMD to increase their individual market share overall.

AMD is profitable they have a P/E ratio in the mid-30s and room to improve over the next several years. This is a very attractive investment in a growth company with moderate risks for that portion of risk/reward of my portfolio.

They've also maintained revenue during short-term manufacturing cutbacks in the chip manufacturing sector, including from Taiwan Semiconductors that they rely on for manufacturing. When this issue is fully fixed, they will have more runway to grow revenue a couple of years out.

I'm long on AMD 340 shares.",cwdawg15,1,/r/stocks/comments/ncyqua/risks_regarding_amd/gy8caj2/,0.029,0.784,0.187,0.9896
236,AMD," > If the mining boom slows down because the bubble has burst or something similar, I fear for the demand for graphics cards. I know it's rather partially dedicated mining cards used to mine, but to a large extent GPUs as well. Won't the used market for graphics cards then be flooded with cheap goods and the demand for new graphics cards collapse?

Probably not, last time crypto collapsed that didn't happen. Graphics cards are prone to wear and tear especially under heavy workloads like crypto mining. Buying a used card is like buying a used car without knowing the car's history. You might get a good deal or you might get garbage. 

> Also, many tech companies are starting to design their own chips, for example Apple, Microsoft and Amazon (the latter for their server business). And you can see from Apple's example that they are also very good at this.

I wouldn't worry about it, the chips these companies are coming up with address a deficiency in the market for a particular product. Apple's chip is interesting and they have been working on it for a while but I don't expect to see it in non-Apple products. 

> How do you assess the two risks? Or can you think of other reasons not to buy AMD (or other chip designers)?

Long term my main concern is competition from Intel and Nvidia. Intel because it is massive and they are making massive investments in R&D. Nvidia because of the ARM acquisition and their position as a market leader in the GPU market.",ThePandaRider,1,/r/stocks/comments/ncyqua/risks_regarding_amd/gy8iupd/,0.053,0.845,0.102,0.9371
237,AMD," AMD, to me, looks like it still has room to grow.

A few main events stood out to me which shouldn’t have been priced in / was unforeseen in the market.

1. Semiconductor Supply/Demand
I mean, there’s always been a high demand for this. But AMD’s stock shot up BEFORE we had a real issue in the supply sector. I remember back in August, we were talking a potential shortage of chips. Now a days, no one can get them. I drove past a dealership lot the other day and they had MAYBE 20% of cars in their lot. The demand won’t decrease anytime soon, and there’s only profit to be made in the sector. Their stock hasn’t necessarily increased all that much since then.

2. Console parts
I remember when the rumor was initially announced; Sony was ordering 50% more parts for their consoles, Microsoft could follow soon. Their stock? No increase. This was around October, when they were sitting around the $80 mark the whole time. This was a huge deal, considering they sold that much more product in the long run (over 4 years or so), but the stock never really fluctuated and only decreased throughout the month leading up to the announcement.

3. Killer earnings
They’ve been destroying earnings quarter after quarter, but their stock price never really reflects this. If they continue to increase at the current rate, I feel the next couple of earnings could be crucial to their valuation.

4. Market share from Intel
I remember just this last month when they posted a large market share increase from Intel within a quarter; this is without their mew Epyc processor line being released soon. I was very impressed with these statistics and could see a large growth in the field in the coming years. Getting people to switch over (from Intel to AMD) is the hardest part; staying with a company is relatively easy and requires little effort. 

5. Ideology of “Cyclical” Stocks
We see the rotation into cyclical stocks form growth stocks to keep with the pace of inflation. I believe we are nearing the age where cyclical stocks aren’t only classic necessities (energy, materials, food, etc), but also technological necessities. In my eyes, semiconductors are the number one technological necessity as we continue to progress into a technological age. Therefore, these semiconductor companies aren’t only a growth stock, but also becoming a cyclical one. The market may be pooling “tech stocks” together, keeping Apple, AMD, Microsoft, and a bunch of other NASDAQ companies, and therefore reduce positions in those companies upon their transition. However, we may come to a realization that semiconductors will function more as a cyclical stock in the near future, and see a rush of investors into the sector. I believe a portion of this has already started (last year), but more will follow.",NovaticFlame,1,/r/stocks/comments/ncyqua/risks_regarding_amd/gy8sd5v/,0.044,0.856,0.1,0.9788
238,AMD, The only risk of investing in AMD is becoming too good for your friends and family because you got so rich.,aegeanrain,1,/r/stocks/comments/ncyqua/risks_regarding_amd/gy986od/,0.071,0.572,0.357,0.8596
239,AMD," I would have invested a large chunk of my portfolio at 2-10$, back when it was a fraction of Intels marketcap, but now I think you're playing with fire at over 1/3rd given the limited potential upside.  Companies are stupid, they dont want AMD, if the two chips are priced the same they will buy Intel every time.

I would also be very afraid of cloud services, PaaS and SaaS can easily be made on ARM or RISCV processors.  You have stories of people being hacked and ransomwared every day, meanwhile there are a huge amount of companies running insecure Windows environments all over the globe, the shift will be quick to the cloud given how overwhelmingly terrible the alternative is.

I'd look at perhaps Kingsoft or Alibaba, China will have a large cloud market as well and they really wont want to be using an American company like Microsoft.  The writing is on the wall with that one I think.",meowman2000,0,/r/stocks/comments/ncyqua/risks_regarding_amd/gy85zn6/,0.144,0.776,0.079,-0.8937
240,AMD," The good:

1. AMD's growth numbers the last 2 years and forward guidance for this year are fantastic. 50% YoY revenue growth 2021. Margins are increasing.
2. AMD's products are superior to Intel. every single benchmark has AMD ahead, save in laptops, where Intel only breaks ahead by increased power consumption (75w vs 95w), which at some level is a threat to laptop battery life. If the preliminary reports are correct. Where performance matters (everywhere except laptops), sales numbers look good. Laptops dont look BAD, it is just that in a supply shortage AMD is prioritizing the highest margin sales.
3. As mentioned by others, the semiconductor market will continue to grow.
4. AMD is gaining market share in the expanding market. AMD has a large runway, a great deal of room to expand. It is entirely feasible to see AMD double its market share in CPUs in the next 1-3 years.
5. the PE of AMD is the lowest it has been in 3 years.

The risks

1. AMD stock has held at present levels for 10 months now. AMD has traded sideways in growth for up to a year and a half before (2018), but its hard to believe that in face of such sound fundamentals AMD stock does not eventually respond.
2. I agree with other posters that in the short term there might be more pain due to the inflation storyline.
3.  Because of the strained semiconductor market, it is unclear to big investors at revenue levels just how big AMD's edge is over intel. Intel's revenues remain strong because demand is so high. That demand is forecasted to drop, which is one reason why investors are leery of the huge numbers posted this last quarter (stimmy bumps). If AMD has strong numbers relative to intel in the next 2 quarters (6 months) I have to imagine even the most cautious investor has to realize that AMD's edge is enough. Having bought computers for 15 years, I can say with relative confidence that AMD's performance benchmarks are sufficiently good that even previously loyal intel customers are now looking at AMD. I am one of those who has flipped. My opinion is not the market's, and revenues are more important than sentiment. I believe the revenues will come, but for the next 3-6 months maybe intel continues to hold up in the eyes of investors who are used to the story of intel being king.

Why I am optimistic in face of the risks

1. I think the inflation story is overblown. I think inflation numbers are due in large part to supply shortages at all levels due to covid. Shipping costs and time are dramatically higher. raw materials are out of stock and are more expensive to purchase. Semiconductors are in short supply, and companies which would like to be producing in their factories (car manufacturers) are idling plants. People are buying more than there is inventory, not because of stimulus checks but because of global rampdowns last year taking effect. The price increases on basic things is passed down to the consumer, but eventually the market will equilibrate to the new demand.
2. The Economy is growing. In the last month I have been struck by the sheer number of signs advertising that companies are hiring. This says to me that companies expect and are ramping up. I suppose it is true that after this pandemic many workers no longer think fast food and retail jobs are worth super low salaries, but that is not a terrible thing. The outcome will be more dollars in workers pockets, which is only inflation (to me) if: A, worker salaries are a primary cost in the bottom line of these companies, which I doubt, given McDonald's effortless ability to raise their minimum wage; or B, minimum wage workers start having so much extra cash that they stop bargain hunting, which seems unlikely to me. The minimum wage earners I know are delaying health care and car maintenance and other large expenditures because they are struggling to make ends meet. They are not purchasing toys for kids, they are certainly not buying clothes at 25% markups.
3. Crypto will continue to be around in the short term, but even without it computers and gaming consoles are becoming more and more ubiquitous.

1. Zoom has a unique (and overlooked) economic moat with a high barrier of entry. <100ms latency during vid conferencing is an impressive technology, and a very expensive one to replicate from competitors. There's a reason why Slack couldn't enter the video conferencing market, or why Microsoft has taken forever in integrating Skype into Teams (and brought subpar results compared to Zoom imo), even though they acquired Skype years ago.
2. They are no longer a 1-product company. Zoom Phone is expanding Zoom's TAM beyond the video communications market to the broader telecommunications market, and they are also offering other solutions such as their App Marketplace to enhance the Zoom experience and ecosystem.
3. Their CAGR over the next 3 years is projected at roughly 30% per year, which is right around the ballpark of some Reddit darling stocks such as CRWD, NET, and PLTR. Zoom actually has the lowest EV/Sales & EV/EBITDA Ratios out of ALL of them right now (disclosure I own all 4).
4. In addition, there's another commonly used metric called ""the Rule of 40"", to evaluate growing SaaS companies. Simply put, the Rule of 40 = Revenue Growth + EBITDA Margin, and if the sum is > 40, it's typically a SaaS company worth investing in. Zoom's is off the charts at 117%  (107% revenue growth + 10% EBITDA margin).
5. Lastly, I don't think WFH is going to go away forever. As much as there are people who are itching to return to work, there are people who want to work remotely as long as they can. We're already seeing big tech companies offer continued remote work, and a I think it's likely that a hybrid of in-office and remote work will become the norm. This is enough for Zoom to continue to grow at the 30% CAGR pace I mentioned above.

311,IT," I think you’re right. All cloud definitely helped.  I remember some customers running versions of Skype or Lync or whatever they called it.  Some companies were an entire major version behind because corporat IT couldn’t upgrade it. Caused for a pretty bad end user experience. 

You’re confirming that Teams has a good ecosystem, which is what makes it great and beyond just videoconferencing software. 

That said, some IT buyers purposely do not buy everything from the same vendor. A bit of an irony. Buying many different apps from the same vendor gets buyers packaged discounts. But if too many of their apps are from the same vendor and that vendor knows they can’t possibly migrate off without disrupting the lifeline of their business, the customer also lose negotiating leverage when it comes to renewal time. So despite the integrated experience that comes from an single vendor, my experience is that some CIO’s prefer a diverse stack.

\- better user experience -> more efficiency -> better profits

\- flexible licensing . thats the real kicker. it really is the proverbial ""pay as you grow"" model. and can also be scaled down if ever needed.

licenses can be switched and traded in the same company. soneone quits and we hire a new person ? sweet. log in, create new adress, transfer licenses. done. takes 5 minutes tops. you can even automate that.

from my personal experience, the days of CIO´s preferring a diversified stack and all that are long gone. new they want an efficient ecosystem with as few moving parts as possible and if possible- even less overhead and hassle. reduce costs for personnel etc.

why do you think cloud soluttions, cliud infrastructure, etc etc are all growing at the rapid pace ? its because finally companies have realized that the more they can concentrate on their core business, the better they are off.

also, most services cannot be switched and replaced during one term. usually - even if theere is no real vendor lock - you are somewhat commited. unless you throw loads of cash and time and effort into making the switch.

As they can't rely on those fat business accounts. However, they make a pretty penny on the government. The prices the governments pay to the airlines are far higher than what the consumer pays. There has also been a high uptick in DOD and Federal LEO travel. I'm speculating other parts of the government have increased their travel. Anyways, more people are traveling and earnings should not be as bad as they have been for the past year.

348,PLTR," Their past is solid because 15 years working with the government (high praise from the government) and the level of security clearance they have is enough to tell me they're an excellent company with a proven product.. especially when after they go public they work with Amazon and all these different businesses in different fields. I don't think they land all these contracts and all the praise I've seen if their product didn't do what they say it does.

They were expanding fast before they offered their software for free but now that they've done that I view it as hurting their short term but a massive boost to their long term by getting in the door and showing these companies how they need PLTR. You don't do that if your product doesn't work.

That's what I see as the past. I'm not concerned about profits because I see them as a growth company. I know profits will come with all these new contracts they're landing... if I wasn't sure how they would expand or where money would come from then I might be more worried but I can see their path so profits aren't important yet to me. I know a lot of people need to see profits before they invest but thats not my concern with PLTR. 

As a side note I love that their salaries are low and they get stock based compensation. That means insider selling which shakes out investors and they're more invested in growing the company.

I think of Wish as dollar store/5 below. They're also mostly outside of the US and at this price point, I think that they're a viable exposure to emerging markets and to US low cost consumer discretionary. Sure they have competition from Ali and Sea, but I own those too, in higher proportions.  I'd like to see them maintain revenue with less advertising spending.

359,AMC," Regarding AMC investment: 

Silverback here who has been investing over 20 years. I want to try and share realistic expectations for a catalyst so any paper hands don’t get discouraged. AMC is a value play in my opinion this is not financial advice. Anything can happen good or bad in the stock market. If you compare Ford Motor company, ticker symbol (F) with AMC they have both been undervalued, AMC more so due to COVID-19. In the last year Ford was undervalued at around 4.52 and went as high as 13.62. This is very quick, tripled in value, within one year. That is a triple your investment which is difficult for these 100 year old companies. Many in this community are used to seeing penny stocks, tech companies, new marijuana companies or Tesla rocket over a 100 percent. That’s not the norm for these older established companies like Ford and AMC or most other companies. The good news is that AMC is severely undervalued and should double, maybe triple, from this 10 dollar level. Of course I am hoping for a squeeze and astronomical returns due to the extreme shorting. I could be wrong but a real catalyst would be your average investors or whales say to themselves “Hey, AMC is an easy double or triple my money from this 10 or 15 dollar level.” This may really cause a surge in buying. Or CEO Adam Aron comes up with news that nobody thought was going to come out like AMC is starting gaming tournaments on the big screen and a follow on surge in money for the company. Another catalyst could be news of a famous whale investor that has new found confidence in the company or maybe something like a partnership that was unexpected like with talk of an Amazon buyout. AMC may get a bump on better than expected earnings soon, but I think the fake news will negatively influence the real story and say “well earnings were better than expected, but they are still far below where it should be and theaters are a dying business,” same old fake narrative...etc. My point is to encourage apes to have patience, nothing guaranteed in the stock market, but at a minimum I’m looking for a 100% return on my investment which is phenomenal and think there is room for a catalyst that no one is expecting sending AMC to the moon. Patience is key.

That's obviously not rooted in fundamentals, given the company hasn't had any notable revenue for a year now and had a struggling business model even before Covid.

381,ETN," I definitely went unconventional, and added a lot of risk that most people aren't comfortable with. I'm currently in USOI for the coupon payments, and snapped up a ton of PBR when it bottomed out after Bolsonaro fired their CEO. My thesis is that USO has hit its floor with oil demand returning to pre covid levels, and the 25% yield is a lower risk investment, although the ETN structure represents more risk than normal investments.

382,PBR," I definitely went unconventional, and added a lot of risk that most people aren't comfortable with. I'm currently in USOI for the coupon payments, and snapped up a ton of PBR when it bottomed out after Bolsonaro fired their CEO.

383,AFRM," To start, don't look at it as ""supporting"" your picks. This isn't a sport, and there are no teams. Support doesn't mean anything. Taking AFRM as an example, you bought in when they were valued at roughly $21B, right? I would assume you have reason to believe they're worth $25B, or $30B, or whatever value you placed on them. Assuming nothing has changed regarding their financials, performance, whatever, you would still have that target estimate. So anything south of that would be a discount to you, and a decline in share price is irrelevant, because you have reason to believe it's worth $30B.

Another aspect of AMC's Problems is the rapid rise in consumer prices from 2""x4""'s, cars, food, housing, rent etc, This is sucking up disposable income, leaving EVERYONE with less.

Something your not seeing yet, but will be front page news soon. Is the stopping of land lord's being able to start evictions on none paying renters.There's hundreds of millions of evictions coming very soon. And all those jobs out there going unfilled are shit jobs, working 2 of those jobs will not pay the bills.

444,AMC," Got to love the lengthy FUD posts where 90% of what they say is complete bollox. 

Evaluating the company's value to say it's market cap is too high is a favourite. Market cap is the total float value. Nothing more nothing less. It's whatever a company's shareholders say it is by their actions and sentiment on the stock. Market cap is also completely irrelevant on a short squeeze play. No one excepts it to just shoot up and stay there. 

The dilution FUD was a good one too. Their current offering is done. They can't issue anymore shares without our approval and they aren't even asking us to anymore. 

They have the most free money on hand they have ever had in their 101 year history relatively speaking which alone will last them until 2023 at which point covid will hopefully be a distant memory. 

They are also currently working on their debt structuring. 

To the mutterings of cinema is dead because streaming. Yeah that must be why Disney and Netflix are bleeding subscribers while Godzilla Vs Kong (a movie that was available for streaming) just crushed it at the cinema. Just because someone doesn't like the cinema doesn't mean their opinion is the majority one. That's just ignorant. 

I love the massively overvalued rubbish too. Based on what? Because you want it to be? Stock is pure sentiment. No one gets to say it can only be this much because fundamentals. If that was the case Tesla wouldn't be over 500 either. Sensible valuations though puts AMCs current stock price at 13 to 16. Given that's where we are just under no one current will be bag holding. 

But.. and more important.. why do you care? 

If you think it's a bad play why are you even taking the time to write this FUD piece? It serves absolutely no purpose other than FUD and you have absolutely nothing to gain from it. Perhaps you're thinking of applying for a job at The Motley Fool and wanted an example article to show them. Who knows. 

However, ultimately you're actually right with your title. Of course an AMC short squeeze will create bag holders when people FOMO into it. Just the same as GME did.

454,AMC, So for one...please link the info that says short interest is 20% or below. It is literally 12 times that but please show me ur reference and we will go from there. I know as the debater here the proof of burden is on me but the sites that have the correct...as best we know...data require subscriptions from what I know and I also dont know how to create/find/share links on reddit(still a bit of a reddit newbie). Also yes there will be another 500m shares dumped onto the float but the offer is off the table...as it was to be voted on...was voted down...then taken off the table until next year ie after the squeeze...and all of us plan to continue to buy more as we believe if we support the company it will not only survive but thrive and we can make more money post squeeze off of actual stock fluctuation and value after the hedgies are gone. Also they have had record numbers for how many locations they have open and with the capacity requirements there are in place. Within the next month they will be open 100% I'm sure as restaurants are at capacity and as of today the cdc says we dont need to wear masks en masse anymore...driving more ppl to go to the movies. We have already proven movies are here to stay and many ppl not only want to go back out to them but actually miss them and the at least 3.2 m retail shareholders of AMC have been going off the wall renting entire theatres and buying meals at concession and generally supporting the company in every way the company needs them too. They paid off 2 and some change billion of their overall debt this year and also converted I believ another 60pm or so debt for equity with a debt holder...yes there cost of business is 300m a quarter but last quarter...while under capacity restrictions with limited new features and reworking their entire platform...plus opening when the quarter was half over...they made more than 300m so they made cost and then some sobi believe this quarter will be much nicer numbers for bbn us to see. I understand where u are coming from but our community believes inthis...and no to the ppl who are using it as a get rich quick scheme or dumped their life savings into it are not going about it the right way...but most of us our heart is in the right place and i personally have thousands inves th ed but honestly i could lose all that and not care...yes this is about the money a bit and i am hoping to get rich but it's about standing up to market manipulators and hedgies fucking the everyman and no i dont want them to die but i want them to live how we have even if just for awhile whole we are set for the rest of our lives if we play it right. We dont wan td to crash the economy and we dont want to crash the market necessarily but we want things to change and from what we have heard...unofficially...the sec is getting involved...big time. So again u are allowed to have ur opinion and if u do nvm t believe please dont buy in when the getting good as 1 u dont deserve it and 2 u will prolly hurt the rest of us if u paperhand and daytrade the stock. There are a lot of ifs in this movement and nothing is guaranteed but we have a colle five dream and this community is awesome if nothing else. We believe in the dd and info we have and are convinced it's right and I really dont know where ur getting that 20% short interest from because its costing them 250% for their un closed shorts everyday from ortex and I just want to know after this wall of text where ur getting that info from because in my opinion...as I've only read it and do not know for absolute certain as i am not a hedgie work at the office or from ortex and wherever else...but in my opinion u are very wrong.

455,AMC," AMC is not a long term play. There is nothing about AMC that signals that it's stock price should be higher now, or in the future, than it was a couple years ago.

GME is making a huge transition to e-commerce and overall being a much larger, more interactive entity in the gaming/entertainment world as a whole.  They have assembled an impressive team to turn the company around in a space that has plenty room for their growth.  GME is a buy whether you believe in a squeeze or not, IMO.  Easy win.

AMC has very little squeeze potential compared to GME as well. If you believe otherwise, you really need to take some time and do some research to try to understand what you are looking at. 

The movement is GME, it always has been. The big brains that are doing AMA's about the short situation are doing it on GME subs, and AMC doesnt get mentioned.  DFV never believed in AMC and most likely still does not have a position in AMC. 

An AMC squeeze is possible, but most hodlers believe it is a distraction away from GME and a way to divide people.  IMO AMC is for people who think they are ""too smart"" to get sucked into GME but think they have stumbled on the new play, and shares are cheaper as well so it's easy to get into.  I do have 30 shares of AMC that I bought from time to time with leftover money in my account, just in case, but it's not even .1% of my portfolio.

IMO AMC is for people who think they are ""too smart"" to get sucked into GME but think they have stumbled on the new play, and shares are cheaper as well so it's easy to get into.  I do have 30 shares of AMC that I bought from time to time with leftover money in my account, just in case, but it's not even .1% of my portfolio.

I wish the best for everyone and dont want to see AMC believers left holding the bag.  It saddens me, though, to see that so many people have been duped out of the real play here and are so convinced otherwise.  Do your own DD everyone!

512,AMC," Right. I started buying AMC before I heard about a squeeze potential. Just thought it was insanely low priced compared to a smaller theater chain. I’ve lost money in very stock purchase except AMC and been holding and buying since beginning of the year, averaging up. When the entire market is red, AMC stayed green this week. 

AMC is highly undervalued. Those who don’t believe that don’t need to worry. They don’t have to buy into it. But it does make me question why they take it upon themselves to post about it. Like what’s the purpose? Why does it matter to them if they have no hidden motives?

The thesis amongst the GME folk (myself included) is that the true short interest since January has been obfuscated via a mix of failure to delivers, options strategies (such as using the purchase of far otm puts from market makers allowing those market makers to legally sell synthetic shares on the market, and hence naked short without technically breaking the law) and via shorting ETF's containing GME, and that the true short interest may now be even higher as they've continued to try and suppress the price.

Since January, GME holders have become more angry, understood the situation better (including how the price is set by whatever the collective can hold to) and have subsequently raised their price targets.

Retailers, the market and all the variables at play decided the value, fundamentals don't really matter with these situations. The value is what people will pay for it.

I understand why you lol'd, but fundamentals are always only one side of the story and they increasingly don't seem to matter anymore. I would say non-financial variables are almost *more* important in today's market. Optics, hype, etc. go a long way. 

It's valuable because people like it and because people believe it has a future. There are tons of examples of this. Good luck telling TSLA holders to dump all their shares just because the market cap doesn't match the fundamentals.",TheFOMO,1,/r/stocks/comments/ncl56i/why_i_think_amc_will_result_in_bagholders/gy67z4y/,0.075,0.796,0.129,0.8944

563,AMG," Tbh for me Tesla is a gimmick. It's price can never be justified but people still worship Tesla because of Elon Musk. 

Tesla as a car company is nothing super special. Yes, they are currently leaders in EV but for how long? Every major brand is catching up. Also Tesla for me lacks a certain character. 

F.e. Daimler (Mercedes-Benz) is known for it's AMG brand (just look at that sexy EQS), Porsche is known for sports cars, Asian manufacturers are known for cheap but good products, VW is known for German engineering etc. 

Tesla is not a bad company but the valuation is the problem. It should not be higher valued than f.e. BMW or Daimler (atleast not right now), let alone be more expensive than all car manufacturers together.",AMGsoon,16,/r/stocks/comments/ncj5z4/i_dont_understand_tsla/gy5ckri/,0.136,0.748,0.116,-0.2746

any other company, Elon would have been forced out by now after the Thai pedo tweets, the ambien tweets, the dogecoin stuff ... he's more than a little erratic.

TSLA is over valued by all logical reasoning, as are many other stocks.  

The only thing that matters for stocks is how much marketing buzz can be created, increasing investor interest and confidence.

Look at all the meme stocks for another example.  They're only valuable because enough apes buy them, which then causes institutional investors or computer trading systems at big brokerages to buy them.

I've made a decent amount of money off of stocks, but I make no illusions that it's just gambling based on feelings, not any kind of intrinsic or real value.",Aioeyu,-3,/r/stocks/comments/ncj5z4/i_dont_understand_tsla/gy5c3gh/,0.022,0.835,0.143,0.8481
