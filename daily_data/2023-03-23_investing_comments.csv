2. Can he improve return, possibly by waiting a month or two for the market to absorb yesterday's rate change.

40,UK," > A ""growing business"" is going to face major challenges in an inflationary environment. 

Might that depend on the ""pricing power"" of the business? 

With pricing power a business makes more than before since you can raise prices ahead of inflation but pricing power allows you to keep your own costs from rising. Lacking pricing power you suffer as the opposite happens to you and you are squeezed. 

Notice to double money supply and double prices / incomes is a hassle but it does not really change wealth only the units used to measure it. 

Sure there is wealth impact due to inconvenience of updating prices  ditto those lacking pricing power are squeezed (eg retirees supporting themselves using non indexed bonds / fixed income suffer). Banks like SVB that failed to hedge interest rate risk suffer. 

> If inflation does persist above 5%, then the Fed will need to continue tightening. 

Yes they will. Last inflation rate quote for USA was 6% for UK like 10.4%

> They will need to slow the economy, and likely bring on a recession.

To slow the economy down the cost of capital has to be above inflation not below it. How much higher need rates go? 

Till interest rates rise above inflation  the effective interest rate is negative and inflation simply eats your debt does it not? Debts at interest rates below inflation are earning assets are they not? If you could you'd get as much such debt as you could would you not?

Right now with USA inflation at 6% and short term USA rates at 5% (but longer term rates lower) will the economy slow down? Has it slowed down despite the rate hikes? Why would it slow down till cost of capital gets above inflation? 

> At higher interest rates, the value of a company's future cash flows decreases. 

What matters for this calculation: cost of capital before inflation? (Today this is 5%) Cost of capital after inflation? (Today this is -1%). 

> You saw it in 2022. Amazing companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon all took huge drawdowns on their stock price. 

You think stocks move based on the present value of future cash flows and not ""animal spirits"" of masses? 

> So the reality is, if inflation persists the way you describe, stocks are likely lower next year. 

Not for the discounted cash flow  reason you expect however. Margin called on loans there will be chains of forced discounted selling and short term that pressure will pull prices down. Over decades? Sure the present value of discounted cash flows matters.

> And quite honestly, we'd have a bit of a disaster on our hands if the current hiking cycle did not achieve its goal in bringing down inflation.

Rising interest rates above inflation will work no doubt however: Last time inflation hit current levels how long did it take to get it back to low levels? How high did interest rates have to go? 

How can we know this time will be different? Are the politics different? Because hiking interest rates is easy? 

Because no danger to banks and lenders who have long term debt (MBS, etc) at low rates who will become illiquid then insolvent as rates rise?

Because no danger of those holding large variable rate loans being unable to afford them and being forced to sell off assets such as houses which will undermine the collateral backing MBS loans?",czl,1,/r/investing/comments/11zblzr/a_friend_today_told_me_hes_considering_moving/jdc3ycr/,0.142,0.717,0.14,-0.6847

To slow the economy down the cost of capital has to be above inflation not below it. How much higher need rates go? 

Till interest rates rise above inflation  the effective interest rate is negative and inflation simply eats your debt does it not? Debts at interest rates below inflation are earning assets are they not? If you could you'd get as much such debt as you could would you not?

Right now with USA inflation at 6% and short term USA rates at 5% (but longer term rates lower) will the economy slow down? Has it slowed down despite the rate hikes? Why would it slow down till cost of capital gets above inflation? 

> At higher interest rates, the value of a company's future cash flows decreases. 

What matters for this calculation: cost of capital before inflation? (Today this is 5%) Cost of capital after inflation? (Today this is -1%). 

> You saw it in 2022. Amazing companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon all took huge drawdowns on their stock price. 

You think stocks move based on the present value of future cash flows and not ""animal spirits"" of masses? 

> So the reality is, if inflation persists the way you describe, stocks are likely lower next year. 

Not for the discounted cash flow  reason you expect however. Margin called on loans there will be chains of forced discounted selling and short term that pressure will pull prices down. Over decades? Sure the present value of discounted cash flows matters.

> And quite honestly, we'd have a bit of a disaster on our hands if the current hiking cycle did not achieve its goal in bringing down inflation.

Rising interest rates above inflation will work no doubt however: Last time inflation hit current levels how long did it take to get it back to low levels? How high did interest rates have to go? 

How can we know this time will be different? Are the politics different? Because hiking interest rates is easy? 

Because no danger to banks and lenders who have long term debt (MBS, etc) at low rates who will become illiquid then insolvent as rates rise?

Because no danger of those holding large variable rate loans being unable to afford them and being forced to sell off assets such as houses which will undermine the collateral backing MBS loans?",czl,1,/r/investing/comments/11zblzr/a_friend_today_told_me_hes_considering_moving/jdc3ycr/,0.142,0.717,0.14,-0.6847

One small quibble here.  Were the injection of the money supply uniform that would be true.  But it generally isn't.  The government (including the central bank) have to pick points of injection in the economy.  Those points of injection do experience a real increase in wealth, often dramatically.  The things closest to them experience an increase in income and investment (depending) before their underlying costs go up.  While the things furthest away experience an increase in costs generally before their own income goes up.  This gets called ""economic distortion"" in less charitable language. 

> To slow the economy down the cost of capital has to be above inflation not below it. 

Again I mostly agree.  Negative real interest rates are all other things being equal highly inflationary.  They certainly encourage excess borrowing, money supply expansion and economic expansion.  But they are not all determining.   Take a hypothetic where the Federal Government raises income taxes and corporate taxes to 80%, slashes transfer payments but the Fed cuts rates to 1%.  We still go into a depression and fairly quickly 1% is too high. 

One of the big problems the USA has been having is many states and some municipalities  aren't doing deficits to stabilize spending.  They all have a lot less long term financing than they had say 50 years ago.  The net result is a lot of stimulus and austerity coming from state and municipal governments which undermine the effectiveness of simple interest rate models.

50,USA," Thank you for the thoughtful comment! 

>> Notice to double money supply and double prices / incomes is a hassle but it does not really change wealth only the units used to measure it.

> One small quibble here.  Were the injection of the money supply uniform that would be true.  But it generally isn't. 

Indeed this is true. What I described happens when perhaps Euros replace some native currency. All the prices and balances are scaled by some constant factor but wealth does not change just the units to measure it changes.

>>The government (including the central bank) have to pick points of injection in the economy.  Those points of injection do experience a real increase in wealth, often dramatically. 

Indeed. If money supply is doubled by just printing up the cash whoever gets to spend that cash has applied a 50% spending power tax to all others who hold that currency.

>  The things closest to them experience an increase in income and investment (depending) before their underlying costs go up.  While the things furthest away experience an increase in costs generally before their own income goes up.  This gets called ""economic distortion"" in less charitable language. 

Yes. In less charitable language it is also called outright theft by some. But what is it really? It is a tax on spending power. Like all other taxes there is ""economic distortion"". It can be good. It can be bad. Depends on what the collected tax is used for. Unreasonable to use it to prevent economic heart attack during emergency economy shutdown by redistribution of spending power?  If there is a good use can there be a better one? 

>> To slow the economy down the cost of capital has to be above inflation not below it. 

> Again I mostly agree.  Negative real interest rates are all other things being equal highly inflationary.  They certainly encourage excess borrowing, money supply expansion and economic expansion.  But they are not all determining.   Take a hypothetic where the Federal Government raises income taxes and corporate taxes to 80%, slashes transfer payments but the Fed cuts rates to 1%.  We still go into a depression and fairly quickly 1% is too high. 

To soak up spending power via higher taxes is certainly another way to slow down the economy but this route likely takes far longer and is more unpopular and more error prone that boosting short term interest rates. 

How often does a democracy vote itself 80% taxes? When public spending exceeds what is collected democracies attempt to outgrow their debts when possible and inflate them away otherwise. 

Taxes on investment and taxes on corporate activity discourage both which is undesirable. Consumption taxes I think are best but not easy to implement - I have an idea how but that would be a long tangent discussion.

I understand your individual words but not what they mean when put in that order. How would you explain this to someone that knows close to zero about American state and municipal taxation and spending? 

>> How can we know this time will be different? Are the politics different?

And because you think America today is closer to the situation in the late 1940s and early 1950s you think economics of those decades is **more likely** to repeat than economics from  the mid 70s and early 80s? 

What happened in the late 1940s and early 1950 was:

https://countrystudies.us/united-states/history-114.htm

>>> The Postwar Economy: 1945-1960
United States History
As the Cold War unfolded in the decade and a half after World War II, the United States experienced phenomenal economic growth. The war brought the return of prosperity, and in the postwar period the United States consolidated its position as the world's richest country. Gross national product, a measure of all goods and services produced in the United States, jumped from about $200 thousand-million in 1940 to $300 thousand-million in 1950 to more than $500 thousand-million in 1960. More and more Americans now considered themselves part of the middle class.

My guess is that this post WW2 growth surge was due to America helping replace stuff (and production capacity for stuff) destroyed abroad in WW2 (Marshall plan etc) and also meeting backlog demand suppressed by WW2 and also cold war preparing for WW3. 

This time around we had economic shutdowns due to COVID and a cold war with China is starting yet nothing has destroyed production capacity abroad so can America grow much via exports? Without desperate export markets abroad (like after WW2) what will juice America's domestic growth?

Are you thinking the Ukraine war will spread in Europe and get more destructive? That and a destructive  conflict with China undermines Japan and South Korea and Taiwan?

> For example:  workers in the 1970s had been through 50 years of government policy redistributing wealth down; workers in the 2020s have been through 40 years of government policy redistributing wealth up.

You describe the sentiment but is ""government policy redistributing wealth up"" necessary? 

You start with 100 and I start with 200 and over decades of economic stability my wealth will pull away from yours even if we both have the same compounding returns from investments. Left alone just the  compounding returns from investments redistributes wealth ""upwards"" does it not? 

And with unequal ability and unequal rates of growth to catch up with lottery winners (business, birth, ...) can be difficult. This is why I ask whether  ""government policy redistributing wealth up"" is necessary? If you have private property and stability this redistribution upwards of wealth just naturally happens over time, does it not? 

And when you say:

> workers in the 1970s had been through 50 years of government policy redistributing wealth down

Those old policies to redistribute wealth down have they been removed? Just eroded? 

Perhaps the real difference was that we lost after effects of forced government policy to destroy vast wealth (WW2) and then government policy to both destroy and invest vast wealth in preparation for WW3? 

Compare society sitting fat and happy on wealth vs being hungry to rebuild destroyed wealth and being eager to prepare for the next big wealth destruction event (WW3). The motivation and results will be different.
The market power of labor vs capital will certainly be different. Why do you suppose the power of unions waned? Was it because of the roll back of their rights? No. I think what happened was their market power was undermined by global trade.

ETFs are ""baskets"" of stocks.  For example in terms of AI etfs, the BOTZ etf is 8.76% Nividia, 8.4% Intuitive Surgical, and the 83% rest of it is 48 other stocks.

Besides BOTZ and IRBO, other ETFs focused on AI or robotics include ROBO, ROBT and AIQ.  These are a good place to start, but you need to do the work to educate yourself on what ETFs are and then what companies and what type of ETFs you want yo get.  Nothing wrong with getting more than one that focuses on the same industry but are balanced differently like BOTZ and IRBO are.

72,CME," For a TUT trade you can use two year and ultra ten year treasury rate futures https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/us-treasury.html. Note that these futures reference several deliverable securities and will most closely track what's called the cheapest-to-deliver. CME has a tool to help identify which bond that is: https://www.cmegroup.com/tools-information/quikstrike/treasury-analytics.html   
CME also has various short rate futures like SOFR, Eurodollar, and FFR https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates.html#products",kiwimancy,1,/r/investing/comments/11zedcz/daily_general_discussion_and_advice_thread_march/jdcwaxz/,0.0,0.852,0.148,0.802

77,EM," The risk of EM is well known which is why EM tends to trade at lower P/E ratios. I'd say expected returns are no higher or lower than other markets once the risk has been factored in, though they could be useful for diversifying returns in a portfolio.

Most EM funds are ~50% China and Taiwan, so the future of EM fund performance is going to depend on those two countries, for better or worse. It's a rather concentrated bet for my taste.",Omnuk,0,/r/investing/comments/11zkfhd/msci_world_vs_all_world/jdd3x6z/,0.148,0.768,0.084,-0.6124
78,MSCI," MSCI and FTSE are benchmark providers.  Both provide a huge variety of benchmarks that funds and ETFs can use.

 For passive world/global trackers you have 2 decisions

- do I want developed markets only or do I want developed and emerging markets exposure combined?

- do I only want large companies or do I also want small companies?

In investing theory you want maximum diversification across all assets so you choose the include everything option.  That would be the FTSE Global Total Cap or the MSCI ACWI IMI.

This link will explain in more detail far better than me.

79,EM," A market cap weighted, total world fund holds about 3% China and 2% Taiwan. I'd be okay with that level of exposure and the extra political diversification would probably be beneficial.

80,ABC," Long term it may not outperform just investing in the total market, maybe it will.

I do not see a compelling reason to focus on dividends vs just total returns. Dividends are purely physiological almost.

If a stock ABC appreciates 10% and stock XYZ pays a 5% dividend and appreciates 3% its easier for our brains to see the return on XYZ, hey we get more shares and more shares = better right?

I mean 9 dimes  is better vs 1 dollar bill right? 9>1 so it must be better.",SirGlass,1,/r/investing/comments/11zoof9/how_effective_are_dollar_cost_averaging_and/jddfc91/,0.017,0.738,0.245,0.9706

83,JNJ," All based on their current prices.

MSFT dividend yield is 1%

APPL dividend yield is 0.58%

JNJ dividend yield is 2.82%

NKE dividend yield is around 3.9%

&#x200B;

So excluding Blackrock, MSFT and APPL I would not consider dividend stocks.  JNJ and NKE you could say are dividend stocks.  Based purely on their dividend yields.

Also based on those, I believe APPL has had the largest growth of all of them, and it has the lowest dividend yield.

So I'm still not seeing much of an argument that focusing on dividend yields are better than focusing on growth.  Even going off of your provided examples, you're about 50/50 on growth/dividends also, so there isn't much of a focus there.",taplar,1,/r/investing/comments/11zoof9/how_effective_are_dollar_cost_averaging_and/jddh4pu/,0.041,0.894,0.065,0.4588

88,IT," No industry is immune except for working for the governments. Healthcare and Utilities are considered as relatively safer but it depends on your role. If you are a healthcare provider or utility worker (think technician) then you are safe irrespective of the environment but if you are in those sectors behind a desk managing IT, administration work etc. then you are as much at risk as other industries.

I am a veteran of two brutal recessions (2000-2003 and 2008-2011), and the worst hit sectors were tech, consumer discretionary retail and travel industries.
