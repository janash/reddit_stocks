5,UPS," This was talked about when I was lower management in 2018. It was just lower-level speculation, but the speculation was only happening because someone higher up mentioned it in passing. 

At least then, Amazon way way too far away from being able to compete with UPS' real moneymaker, overnight express delivery. Profit on ground packages is pennies, if that. Other air deliveries make up for the loss, and overnight express brings in the profit. 

Amazon simply doesn't (didnt back then anyway) have the infrastructure to make next day air profitable the way UPS can, and doesn't make up enough from their other delivery services to compensate. All that, and there isnt even mention of UPS freight services for heavy items. Amazon doesn't do anything like that, afaik.

There was definitely concern about Amazon moving further and further away from UPS however they can, though.

Full disclosure I have UPS stock, and cognitive dissonance is a helluva drug. I like the union UPS employees are a part of, too, so it's even more of an emotionally driven thought process in some ways.",rmsayboltonwasframed,2,/r/stocks/comments/p2cunv/amazon_opens_its_15_billion_air_hub_in_kentucky/h8k3i4z/,0.05,0.832,0.118,0.9249
6,UPS," We spend 25k a week on UPS shipping our Amazon orders 
As a third party seller who was using Amazon to pick up and ship all our packages before covid I can tell you it saved us a lot of money and they only did ground shipping 1-5 days and told us they where working on integrating with Amazon air to offer 2 day delivery .

Once that happens it’s going to be a game changer . It will help their sellers ship direct and stop overloading the fba warehouses as well .

For being part of the test run before covid it was very good for being basically “ year one “ they don’t care if the shipping portion makes tiny margins which is what will give them an advantage . 

3-5 years ground shipping will stop using UPS / FedEx almost completely except remote areas .

16,UPS," But its not cheaper to do it better.  Look at FedEx and USPS on delivery reliability.  If amazon cut their shipping agreements with other companies, and did the job poorly, it could cause some friction with sales.  You need air support for your car/truck distribution to be fast, yes, but amazon already has drivers peeing in bottles to keep up. UPS didnt start doing that until year 50 or so.  Plus, delivery services might be the floodgates that let unions in, and amazon will fight it, causing more friction.  If amazon wants to distribute, I hope they dodge some of the growing pains by learning from the experiences of these hundred year companies.

56,COST," First, I'm so glad you're looking to add to your winning positions, so many people on reddit want to sell everything as soon as they get a gain.  You should always add to winning positions!! Great job.  

Second, when you add to positions that have substantial gains, a good approach is add about 25-40% to the current value of the position.  If you have a $5000 position, add $1250-$2000.  That way if the stock drops your gains are protected.  You can work with what you feel comfortable with but it's better to add less than none.  

Third, with a stock like COST, you should plan on holding through and adding to your position in any downturn.  The company has nearly 40years of continuous growth and chances are extremely good that it will recover from any downturn in better shape than it started.  

Fourth, if you want to get sophisticated about how you add to positions, look at a long term chart of the company (5-10yr) with the axis set on log.  Then draw a ""eyeball"" best-fit straight line along the trend of the stock, in the middle of the trend.  Ideally, you always buy below the line.

I don't expect them to outperform mega-cap tech in the long run, but it provides some nice short term exposure to Industrials--with infrastructure spending bills being passed now they have room to run a bit. The CEO has also done a great job of turning the ship around, divesting from bloat business, and turning this into a pure Industrials play.

Ultimately, it depends on what percentage of your portfolio they are, what your bull case is, and your risk tolerance. If you think the capital can grow more quickly longer term somewhere else, and you're willing to eat the short term loss for long term gain, I would sell and reinvest the proceeds into something you think will outperform immediately.

Lithium may be a good short-term bet, but I wouldn't count on it for any long-term investments.  If anyone manages to develop a more efficient sodium battery (or one based on anything else), and that could happen next week, next month, or next year (or possibly never, but given the resources being allocated to Na-battery research, I think it's likely) -- if that happens, the entire Li industry is dead.",farahad,1,/r/stocks/comments/p29qg5/which_stocks_to_play_the_battery_shortage/h8k7lg3/,0.039,0.835,0.126,0.9103

They won approval for a new manufacturing facility in Canada with talks of expanding R&D there.

264,TV," I'm looking at their latest earnings report. Switch sales increased a lot in the Americas like I thought (many people I know in the US bought one recently), which is a great sign, esp given their consoles seem to be unavailable at times. Switch Lite sales however is in a huge decline everywhere. That shows that people want the TV option and willing to pay extra for it. It might also be a factor of what was available in stock. That's my main concern that they don't deliver enough consoles due to the chip storage or whatever it may be. 

The other thing is decline in software sales  (I assume this means games), which is expected given the decline in consoles and no new big hit games. In the Americas it increased a bit but declined in all other locations. 

So overall things are not looking so great. However, given 2020'Q2 was really strong due to covid, I'm OK with the overall yoy decline in sales.

You can get lucky, you could go all in on a good looking pick from WSB and win. But you could also lose most of your investment very quickly. 

I suggest spreading your money across at least a few stocks you believe in. Then if one goes down, even temporarily, your portfolio could still move up as a whole.

That's not to say if you are truly sure of something that you shouldn't go for it. In fact if you ""know"" a stock is gonna shoot up, a $300 investment is gonna leave you disappointed. Just don't be surprised if a single stock does the opposite of what you expect.

338,AC," Good newsflow for these companies.  Maybe that can make their stock go up and be good enough for the investment.

But in terms of their actual business, its not good.  Most of these companies have Lvl2 chargers out there.  That's similar to what you have at home.  Takes several hours to charge a car.  Their business model is most similar to RV parks.  And in fact RV parks are used by EV owners for emergency charging.  There is no real margin to this business as the natural competition is the home unit, which can be bought for a few hundred dollars.

Lvl 3 charging is more interesting.  More like a gas station in that a car can be charged in maybe 15 minutes (it varies).  Lvl 3 is DC current versus AC for the Lvl1 and Lvl2.  TSLA leads in Lvl 3 charging (Super Chargers) but its not a profit center for them.  Cost tens of thousands of dollars for each charger.  Again it competes with home charging for most users.  (unlike gas stations which normally don't have to worry about customers getting their own gas at home)  Home charging doesn't have to be fast as the car is parked overnight anyway.  So Lvl 3 charging main market is long distance driving.  A greater number of Lvl 3 chargers across the country is needed to make EVs as practical as ICE cars for long trips.

But there are not enough EVs out there to justify that many Lvl3 chargers.  So they need subsidies to get the network built out enough.  That's great for the equipment suppliers, but not so much for the operators.  They still won't have great margins because there are still not enough EVs out there.  Long term, if you project large growth in EVs, the EV charging business becomes just like your local gas station.  Local gas stations compete on price and location, but rarely have good margins.  But they do have locations already, so relatively easy for them to add Lvl3 charger to their existing facility if the margins ever justify it.

And that's the problem.  It's a crappy existing business, but growing.  But no barriers to entry, so when it becomes big enough to be viable, the existing gas station can just jump in and have a competitive advantage with their existing locations.  Long term, I don't think the pure play charging companies are viable businesses.

349,SPCE," I have been in SPCE two or three times in the past 6months and to me its a short term play.
Buy when it dips and sell when the news comes in and it has never failed me

Now this time round it’s the same
old crap. If it ever dips to around $20, I will go in for sure.

Not a  long term hold cos it would take donkey years to see them churn out any revenue and for now, people are just buying into whatever thing Branson says",JulSGP,1,/r/stocks/comments/p2dyd9/spce_hold_or_fold/h8jwjjk/,0.028,0.891,0.08,0.5862
350,ELY," Don't base your evaluation of a stock on performance from two days when the market generally has also not been as responsive during those same two days.  Especially so during earnings season.  Lately it seems many companies who make/exceed earnings drop share price on selloffs and the ones that don't spike on share price with a drive to buy up shares.

I like ELY long term.  I don't like how some of their clubs (like Odyssey) lack Callaway branding, but does not seem to be hurting them at all.

TopGolf will be a staple of their future revenue.  Only competition here is maybe DriveShack, but that's a few years away from having a bigger impact in more markets.  

Ogio is a great additional company to hold, but they could do more with exposure against North Face, Eddie Bauer and similar competition.  Seems like they TRY to get this under the Jack Wolfskin brand, but who has honestly heard of them?  These two brands should probably join forces under Ogio long term.",HotSarcasm,1,/r/stocks/comments/p2j9f8/can_someone_explain_why_this_ely_is_happening/h8ki08c/,0.046,0.823,0.132,0.9402
351,NYT," This is an uninformed take because the NYT is way bigger and more stable than any media company you’re thinking of. They have the most paid subscribers for their news product by far, they have multiple other paid subscription packages (crossword/gaming, cooking) and they’re also making successful content across platforms like streaming and podcasts that are central to how people consume information. They’re the best positioned news media company by a long shot, regardless of if you don’t fuck w them lol",valuegrowthmoon,3,/r/stocks/comments/p2hpt0/anyone_hold_nyt/h8k5ns4/,0.038,0.793,0.169,0.9061
352,ATH," Do you think Wirecutter gives them an advantage? (They own it)

Also, look at the max/zoomed out chart on yahoo finance. Looks like they just breached their last ATH had about 10 years ago. Will they head back down? Or keep going up?

I hold a small position and am debating whether to sell because of that. I like the company but those 2 big humps make me nervous",redratus,0,/r/stocks/comments/p2hpt0/anyone_hold_nyt/h8k7se2/,0.038,0.882,0.08,0.224

355,CLF," I'm playing it through CLF and NUE.  CLF is being undervalued as LG derisks CLF from its debts.  I don't think the turnaround of becoming a vertically integrated steelmaker has sunk in yet.  It also has a pretty high short interest, so I think CLF is more 'juiced' if it goes on a run.  Of course, it is the riskier name, and it is understandable why it had lagged to its peers.  That is why I recently decided to pair this trade with NUE which has the best balance sheet.

364,CD," What's your timeframe for when you ""need"" the money? If it's long, even if the market crashes you'll probably make it back and then some by investing now and historically you'll be better off than just letting it devalue in your savings.

If it's short (like you want to buy a house in two years) just pop it in a CD and take the pittance your bank throws at you.

We don't know when or how the market will correct. It's most probably going to happen, and it's likely to be in the short timeframe (as far as investing goes).",XnFM,1,/r/stocks/comments/p2bgwu/market_crash_coming/h8js4lw/,0.0,0.958,0.042,0.4939
