1,OR," In my mind either the housing/stock crash OR crazy inflation will happen. Not both. The fed should’ve been raising interest rates for a long time now but hasn’t. It’s had political pressure to keep them low in order for the economy to keep booming. If they keep them low we will see huge inflation until they raise the rates and crash the economy. It would’ve been better if they had done their jobs and regulated the economy in the first place.

> Significant inflation is Imminent

Pick one or the other. It's near impossible to have significant inflation without a significantly rallying stock market

Revenue/profits, which are key valuation metrics for corporations, are denominated in the currency that is inflating and hence will correspondingly increase.

ETA: As others have said, real estate and stock market rallies ARE the hyperinflation. To put it simply, say Dole sold 1 million bananas a year at $0.25/each. They would have revenue of $250k/year. If bananas were to be $10/each due to hyperinflation, then their revenue would be $10 million/yr. 

The stock will hence be re-valuated for a company with $250k revenue to a company with $10 million revenue. You can't have inflation without rising stock prices.

I disagree completely with your assumptions.  Earnings reporting starts this week and they’re going to surprise to the upside and support current valuations.  The real estate market has begun a long-term bull run as Millennials are now finally starting families and buying houses.  Inflation IS transitory as both the Fed and the bond market agree.

6,IMO," Plain old boring asset allocation. The rule of thumb used to be own your age in bonds  - VBTLX for a vanilla and competent example. So if you’re 35 have 35% of your assets in bonds. I think that’s a bit conservative and I would probably go your age -10 or -15 in bonds depending on your risk tolerance. For someone under 40…. A 90/10 or 80/20 portfolio isn’t nuts IMO. Warren Buffet advocated for a 90/10 portfolio for the average Joe a few years ago FWIW. Then, be ready to buy at the dip as you rebalance. 

If you’re super paranoid about inflation, TIPS are also a thing, though I have never seen a use for them except in the most conservative of cases.

If you really think it will be a blood bath, cash is an option for buying opportunities. Though if you’re also worried about inflation, cash could lose a lot if you are thinking late 70s/early 80s.

But, my strategy is one that keeps me in about 60-80% cash generally, but yields (so far because I'm either lucky for the past 4 years or a decent stock picker) about 20% annually.

1. I do a f-ton of DD and macro research and probably spend waaaay too much time studying business, sometimes 20+ hours a week while working 40+ hours a week on top of that...
2. I buy low and sell ""high"".

3. Any investments that rise above 1% return in under 2 weeks I sell, any that rise above 2% in a month, I sell, you get the idea.
4. Any investments that fall, I buy into (DCA), maxing at about 30% of the fund. Then it sits, until we rise above that expected 1-2% a month return, which for the past four years, including covid, only takes anywhere from a few more days to max 3.5 months so far. 

The end result of this strategy is that I typically have slightly higher taxes (costs about a percent a year, so 25% is 24% returns), stay mostly in cash, typically match or beat benchmarks if I had instead put the entire fund into S&P500 or VTI, etc. (the most I've ever been invested with this strategy to date was in april 2020 at about 87% invested).

10,USA," > If you believe that stocks are going to bust, real estate is going to bust, and the dollar is going to decline in value, then where do you think capital is going?

I don't agree with OP but this scenario.  While many Asian and European bonds have low interest rates you could make a case they have low inflation for a long time.  They haven't had the same degree of fiscal stimulus and demographic factors are stronger.   For those investors the USA even at slightly higher interest rates experiencing much higher inflation becomes a risk.  As some sell to realize higher returns at home the remaining investors experience negative real returns in dollar terms and even worse in home country currencies.  If they sell you have a dollar crash.  

Capital flows rapidly out of the USA into Europe and/or Asia.  The USA has had a bad balance of trade for a long time, that reverses causing a very large domestic shift in demand as the USA goes from a medium net importer to a medium net exporter.  That causes inflation to spike hard domestically which further causes bonds to fall.  Because the economy is far overheated the Fed can raise rates and apply a break.  But from the perspective of domestic bond holders this looks like increasing inflation with interest rates well above the rate of inflation (say 10% inflation and 15% interest rates). Needless to say not good for bonds, stocks or real estate.

30,GDP," It is very easy to nit pick statistics to prove myself right, or for anyone to prove me wrong. So I will try to only include statistics in which I believe are consistent to both events. 

My opinion is that the current environment in which our market sits, meets all the criteria for other market crashes in history, and then some. 

A simple google search will give an easy answer to what caused the 2000 market crash which began in March 2000 and is nicknamed the Dot Com Bubble. 

1. Overvaluation of tech stocks, more specifically “.com” stocks 
2. Venture capitalist investment hit incredible highs 
3. Media


——An overvaluation of tech stocks led to people buying past the fundamentals. The financials didn’t matter, it was like the housing market in ‘07, everyone believed that if it was able to be purchased today, then it would be worth more tomorrow. (This is very much the same way today, across growth as well as value.) 


——Venture capitalist investment was an extremely useful tool to help sink the market in 2000. Venture capitalist investment is useful for the growth of industry. It puts money into the hands of those individuals with the ideas to fuel a better tomorrow. However, the barriers to entry for VC investment got extremely low, and in 2000, the venture capital investment hit 119.2 billion dollars. In 2020, the venture capital investment hit 130 billion dollars. 

——Media frenzy. In 1995-2000, the internet and dot com was everything. Right now, it’s obviously Covid. The end of Covid, the reopening after Covid. The economic boost from Covid being over. It is Covid everything and people are being told that once Covid is done, our economy is going to roar again. The narrative is being pushed that we should buy now. 

In these 3 ways, I believe we meet all criteria for the dot com bubble. And we take it a bit further with a few key statistics in my opinion. 

Good news or bad news the stock market goes up. 

All financial asset prices are going up.

Unemployment is higher now then it was then. McDonald’s and Burger King have signing bonuses for new hires. We have an entire army of discouraged workers and we have yet to see the impacts of this. 

Inflation. The federal funds rate is currently .07%, in 2000 it was 6.24%. The lower the FFR, the cheaper it is for banks to borrow money from the fed, which makes it cheaper and easier for consumers to take out loans. More money is being spent, because more money is being loaned.

Stimulus checks were used to bolster the stock market. Retail participation in the market is at an all time high (times 10).

My worry with this is that once new retail investors see red after red after red, there will be mass sell offs and will only make the crash that much more significant.

31,VC," It is very easy to nit pick statistics to prove myself right, or for anyone to prove me wrong. So I will try to only include statistics in which I believe are consistent to both events. 

My opinion is that the current environment in which our market sits, meets all the criteria for other market crashes in history, and then some. 

A simple google search will give an easy answer to what caused the 2000 market crash which began in March 2000 and is nicknamed the Dot Com Bubble. 

1. Overvaluation of tech stocks, more specifically “.com” stocks 
2. Venture capitalist investment hit incredible highs 
3. Media


——An overvaluation of tech stocks led to people buying past the fundamentals. The financials didn’t matter, it was like the housing market in ‘07, everyone believed that if it was able to be purchased today, then it would be worth more tomorrow. (This is very much the same way today, across growth as well as value.) 


——Venture capitalist investment was an extremely useful tool to help sink the market in 2000. Venture capitalist investment is useful for the growth of industry. It puts money into the hands of those individuals with the ideas to fuel a better tomorrow. However, the barriers to entry for VC investment got extremely low, and in 2000, the venture capital investment hit 119.2 billion dollars. In 2020, the venture capital investment hit 130 billion dollars. 

——Media frenzy. In 1995-2000, the internet and dot com was everything. Right now, it’s obviously Covid. The end of Covid, the reopening after Covid. The economic boost from Covid being over. It is Covid everything and people are being told that once Covid is done, our economy is going to roar again. The narrative is being pushed that we should buy now. 

In these 3 ways, I believe we meet all criteria for the dot com bubble. And we take it a bit further with a few key statistics in my opinion. 

Good news or bad news the stock market goes up. 

All financial asset prices are going up.

35,UK," There was a great example a few years ago with the collapse of a high profile airline and travel company in the UK.

Thomas Cook recorded a huge amount of ""goodwill"" on its balance sheet as the value of its brand and trustworthiness as a household name.

It managed to use this to borrow against and effectively had its operational cashflow dependant upon this goodwill. Of course, when they hit upon hard times, they found that no-one was willing to lend them any more money, and that this ""goodwill"" was impossible to cash in when people are suspicious about your financial health.

Towards the end, ""goodwill"" (ie the value of their own brand) accounted for 85% of their reported assets. 

Ultimately, Thomas Cook entered a death spiral of the down-valuing of its goodwill, which led to the cutting off of funding and further down-valuing of the goodwill etc etc.

&#x200B;

37,ABC," Yeah this is a misunderstanding of goodwill. Its an accounting practice that tries to measure things that are not easily priced. 

Company ABC buys company XYZ for 1.2 billion. The assets of the company are 900 million, liabilities are 100, 800 million in total. 

ABC paid a 400 million premium on the book value. That 400 million is goodwill, and it represents things that are hard to price, like brand recognition, or  things like entry into international markets and future revenue increases. It can even measure how a new aquisition can make the parent company ""greener"" which generally boosts PR.

Without goodwill its just a company paying 1.2 billion for 800 million in assets. 

The risk in question is that 400 million premium should have been 200 million. Or will it be ""impaired"" where every year the accountants try and measure it again, only to find that what they paid for isnt worth that anymore.",Kaiisim,11,/r/investing/comments/oijsyk/the_risks_associated_with_goodwill/h4y3y9c/,0.071,0.836,0.093,0.542

47,GDP," I don't know when the next 20% drop will be, but I expect the S&P 500 will \*at least\* double, if not triple or more, over the next decade, contrary to talk of a permanent crash or lost decade.

A few reasons for medium or long-term optimism:

1. Real GDP growth was 6.4% in Q1 2021. Estimates are that GDP growth well above the 2-2.5% we've had for the past couple decades will continue for at least a couple years.
2. The US savings rate is still well above it's average over the last 2 decades, and people still have lots of savings from the pandemic. 
3. The US is on track for its best year of job creation in history. 
4. Many fast-growing sectors of the economy (to over-simplify: ""Tech"") are also some of the highest-paying, and with relatively low barriers to entry (as compared to law, medicine, etc).

People seem to attribute the rising market to the Fed and government stimulus, both of which contribute, but we're also having quite a lot of real, private-sector growth, and I doubt that will stop unless something makes it stop. And a large percentage of the articles, reddit posts, etc predicting a market crash fall into 2 categories:

1. Stuff that has been predicted to cause a crash for a long time, and hasn't (overvalued market, money printing someday causing hyperinflation, too much debt, etc) or

Given we are close to ATH it seems quite risky.",reallylovestoast,3,/r/investing/comments/oiniju/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h4xildv/,0.111,0.772,0.118,0.128
70,AAPL," I have been trying to figure out how to set up my financial future, as well as how much I should be investing for shorter term goals versus saving for retirement in a 401k. Any other general advice is appreciated too, but right now I’m trying to figure out how to balance short term and long term saving.


Currently am 23 and have about $10k in savings for 6 months emergency expenses (8k in an Ally High Yield, 1.8k in Wells Fargo), $53k in ETF/Stocks($22.8k in VOO, $18.2k in VTI, $3.3k in VXUS, $1.6k in BND, $544 in MSFT and $6.5k in AAPL (thats my fun stock)).

Just started my first job with a salary of 80k. I did a budget excel table and the only expenses I accumulate besides food ($300-500 a month), entertainment (roughly $200-300 month) and rent ($1400+150 utilities) is I like buying the latest apple products, but I sell my old ones to fund the new ones, so it only costs me a couple hundred per device. Even with all that I am ending up with around $1000-$1400 a month of extra cash per month (not including my current 401k contribution). Right now, I am saving up for a house and a car (my car is fine but thinking ahead, most likely will want an EV), these are goals for the next 5-7 years, so right now I have been applying that surplus to my ETF’s but I’m not sure if that is the right thing to prioritize. 

Currently have no debt and I am starting to fund my 401k at 12% my salary, my employer matches 3.5%, so I am currently putting away 15.5% of my salary towards retirement.",macdude2010,2,/r/investing/comments/oini1i/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h4yrkss/,0.041,0.87,0.089,0.9145

72,UK, Hey guys I'm wanting to buy etf's. But am struggling to find a place I can buy from. Im 16 and live in the UK. So can't use etoro as they don't have custodial investing and don't allow u18s.

73,GME," I'd like to learn about options trading, looking at buying calls with long expirations to start. What happens in the event of a stock split? How about if shares are issued? If a company has 100 shares and the strike is 100, and they issue 25 shares, does the strike on the contract drop to 80 (4/5 = 100/125)? Also, is there somewhere that I can go to get a listing of options prices? Currently I'm looking at

However, I don't understand what I'm seeing there. GME is trading at 190, and I see a strike of 42 with expiration in a year and a half with a bid/ask of 145/164, and it says in the money +78%. It doesn't really make sense, as none of 190/42, 190/145, nor 190/164 are 1.78.",eagergm,1,/r/investing/comments/oini1i/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h4x1ugg/,0.051,0.872,0.077,0.6662
74,USA," Basic question-  Is there any reason to invest in multiple broad market ETF’s or consolidate into one?  I’m about 50%25%25% in VTI, VUG, VGT.  would there be any practical reason to not invest 100% in any one of them? Would something like capital gains, compounding interest or anything other strategy dictate that one is better than the other?

75,USA," I just don't really know where to start. I'm 19, in the USA, and making about $600 a week (though that will drop either completely or significantly once I start school again in the fall). I have about $3,000 to invest and don't mind moderate to high risk ventures. I'd ideally like to grow my money as much as possible in the next 2-3 years, so I have cash to work with when I graduate. The issue is I don't really know what to look for when picking stocks/mutual funds/etc. or how to go about learning this. I've made money with WSB trades, but I'm well aware those were stupid moves I got lucky with. I'd like to move forward a little more intelligently, I just don't know how.

76,IMO," If your goal is capital appreciation (which is my standard advice for the goal of someone in that age bracket), I would say no.  With 40+ year investment horizon the drag isn't worth it versus stocks.  There are higher risk bond strategies that offer higher returns but even those are a bit pale right now, and require leverage to execute.  Additionally, IMO, the current bond market is especially bad for long term bond results because of where interest rates currently sit.  I was able to get 9+% out of total return bond funds in that age bracket (although Magellan was getting me 20+%), but a lot has changed in the interim.",LiqCourage,3,/r/investing/comments/oini1i/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h4xqa8x/,0.095,0.853,0.052,-0.4538
77,MF," Its also just cost savings , the MF it self basically has to track who owns it and distribute some required materials and that all has over head costs
