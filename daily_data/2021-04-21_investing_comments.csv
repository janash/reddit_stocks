0,KB," I left this comment on another sub also, but it might be appreciated here too:

I haven't bought any Netflix ever, I'm planning on buying in another three months or so, anytime between the second and third quarter earnings announcements.

Here's what few people understand.   I live in rural Georgia (the US State), and like almost all rural people in the US below the southern border of Montana,  I don't have any high speed internet options.  I can't stream movies,  I download games for my kid on Steam at 7 KB per sec, yep, that's right,  slower than dial up I had in the 90s from the AOL disks.  

I've pre-ordered Starlink and gave them $100 deposit and they said are ""targeting the second half of 2021""  for availability in my area.  So far, based on everything I've read on the Starlink sub they are under-promissing what they are doing.  People are reporting much higher speeds than advertised. 

When Starlink is available there are a lot of rural people in the US, and other countries who haven't had the opportunity to get any streaming service before.   After that happens,  you should see a ""surprise "" jump in subscriptions to all the streaming services,  since Netflix is the largest,  most well known,  it should benefit the most.  

Delays in Starlink availability might push this to the fourth quarter,  I think that's unlikely since they successfully launched four rockets last month and one so far this month and have almost filled the first shell of phase one.  Just need some time (up to three months) for the satellites to get in position.   Other possible risk is dish production and delivery delays. 

Anyway,  good hunting and God speed.",bernie638,43,/r/investing/comments/mve8vh/netflix_misses_q1_subscriber_targets_blaming/gvbip23/,0.019,0.872,0.11,0.9801
1,UI," With our family (2 adults, 2 teens), I 'paused' Netflix for a month to try out the Hulu/Disney/ESPN+ package. Had the kids and myself make a list of stuff they wanted to watch on those channels and went for it.

Nothing on ESPN+ (though did end up watching some MLS). Disney...we watched all that we wanted w/in a week. Each of us could count on one hand shows/movies we were interested in. Hulu...I was the only one that didn't completely finish what I wanted there (had 4+ seasons of one of the shows to get through and almost made it) but will do just that channel for a month again toward the end of the year.  


Netflix...we \[almost\] always find something of interest. I've a very long queue and find that rating shows leads more shows of interest to float up in the suggestions. Only my son has a hard time finding stuff but his interests are VERY particular. 

Amazon Prime....meh. A few shows have been good but my god, the UI is horrific.

What about HBO or Paramount? I've seen just a couple on each that are of interest. Not enough to subscribe on my own -- will likely just get DVDs from the library.

3,NFLX," Here’s why I bought further into NFLX after earnings:

Company is paying down debt, seeing significant earnings growth despite subdued new subs, is investing heavily in untapped markets, and winning awards out the wazoo for its massive library of original content.

Product-wise, I get a big kick out of their anime offerings - and although I probably average an hour a day all year round watching stuff w/ my SO, I don’t have any sense that we’re going to ‘run out’, and am constantly surprised by how good some of their own stuff is (there’s still plenty of things I don’t rate highly on the platform).

If they can continue to grow earnings, they don’t need to be exponentially adding subs every quarter. That said, I think that with the planned releases this year they will see higher subs and churn as more people hop in and out to see the new offerings.

I think the platform is excellent value for a lot of people (including myself), and is only likely to improve over time as they continue to learn what works for different audiences.",CalmSticks,1,/r/investing/comments/mve8vh/netflix_misses_q1_subscriber_targets_blaming/gvcot22/,0.013,0.847,0.14,0.9698

They do diverse content and try new things as a strategy, they are basically running things like a late 90s studio instead of a modern one: lots of experimental and new IP, find what sticks and then press on the gas. It keeps the majority not only sated, but it keeps them coming back to try more, and more importantly it keeps many different social circles engaged at once. 

I’m more bullish on Disney, but I have to admit that their strategy is built upon existing IP and continued Disney-style hits and it risks overexposure. The superhero genre has much longer legs than anyone anticipated, but eventually it’ll fade just like any popular cash cow. At one point Disney’s own brand and content was nearly irrelevant, and that point was only a little more than 10 years ago.

They're also facing competition from Hulu and Amazon for originals and whatever scraps are left, and Apple TV and probably a dozen others are also in the ring.

78,JNJ," Good morning contrarians!

Futures are flat after a second straight day of losses for stock markets. Small caps are showing signs of life, up about 0.5%. That’s as of 0630. Yesterday the Russell 2000 dropped 2% and the Nasdaq almost 1%.

There was a very clear reversal in the reopening trade, with pandemic-sensitive names like travel companies seeing most of the selling, while stay-at-home stocks like Costco and Clorox benefited. 

One pandemic winner that didn’t go along for this ride was Netflix, which reported a slowdown in subscriber growth. NFLX is being punished, down to almost $500 per share. We did have earnings beats from Philip Morris, Procter & Gamble, and JNJ. 

PNG and Coke said they were raising prices, which means inflation is a-coming (or is already here). But then the bond market doesn’t really seem to care. Maybe it’s already priced in.

Bottom line: The pandemic fears have not been able to generate much staying power since last April. We’ve seen this movie before and it always turns into a buying opportunity. Will this time be different? 

The macro elements that drive economies — interest rates, employment, real estate — are all pointing in the right direction. The Fed may be forced to act but we aren’t there yet. Big picture virus trends are pointing the right way too, at least in the U.S. and most developed markets.

80,EDIT," Do you know an ADR for the Taiwanese stock Pegatron Corporation?

It looks like they’re building a US factory to supply Tesla with centre console parts

EDIT looked at the financials and Pegatron revenue was about $49 billion in 2020. 

About 440,000 Tesla 3/Y in 2020. 

If Pegatron get $10 revenue per console that’s only $4.4 million. 

Even at an unlikely $100 per console it’s just $44 million revenue. 

So if Tesla doubles EV production in 2021, best case Pegatron add another $44 million to their $49 billion, so less than 0.1%",MurkyGrape5901,4,/r/investing/comments/mvblxw/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gvb6agu/,0.0,0.93,0.07,0.7717

93,SE," If I tried to time every rotation like the one that's gone on in the last 1.5-2 months I'd probably create unnecessary stress, not time it well and I'd wind up selling positions where I have a low cost basis.

I started buying SHOP when it was double digits and I bought and sold and and bought and sold and at $300 I decided to just own it and stop trading in and out of it. I should have just owned it from the get go.

I buy things with the intent of owning long-term and I've been lucky to have been buying in December of 2018 and March 2020. If you have a low cost basis in things it's a lot easier to not be that phased by a correction. I own SE, which went from $280 to about $195 recently before bouncing back to about $240. My cost basis is substantially lower, so while the correction wasn't fun it didn't change my view and didn't really phase me much. If someone bought at $280, they're not thrilled. I think in a lot of cases with investing it's ""last one in first one out"" and the people who were late sell.

If you're buying something great in December of 2020, maybe it's not buying it in March 2020 when things were cratering, but you don't know that it won't look like a very good purchase in a year or two. If it's something great, what may seem like ""buying at a high"" may eventually seem far more appealing in retrospect.

The only time when I have really made a major overhaul was last year into early this year because I bought aggressive growth in March 2020 thinking that I'd be very happy in a year or two, only to luckily be right investing place/right investing time as those names took off for months on end. I thought the kind of performance in 2020 was definitely not sustainable, so gradual changes were made throughout the last half of last year and early this year. I had a very good 2020 but do I ever want to make that kind of overhaul again? Not really; I think I thought more about investing and particularly investing *decisions* last year than the prior three years combined. 

Optimally, for me I really don't want to feel like I have to make day-to-day decisions. I love researching and optimally the majority of investing time for me is looking for new ideas and keeping up with current holdings. I don't like feeling as if a lot of time has to be spent decision making. That doesn't mean no activity, but it's a tweak here and a tweak there. Overhauling a lot of my portfolio (still a good deal of aggressive growth, but less than before and a more concentrated group of names) worked out pretty well for the most part but isn't something I want to do again.

For me it's trying to identify appealing long-term stories and owning them, optimally long-term. If I own something 10 years, great because if I'm owning it 10 years it had to have done pretty well. Those may start off as small holdings and move up from the minors to the majors as an eventual large holding. Things like TTD, SE, SHOP, etc.

And maybe your time horizon/approach/etc are different and more short-term but personally I just think having a long term view and really trying to buy aggressively in December 2018/March 2020 situations (when the CNN Fear/Greed is like a 2; some people said it was briefly 0 in March 2020) is easier. Trying to buy and sell and buy and sell every time there's a correction/rotation I just think for most people leads to frustration.

Lastly, I think if you're all high growth then you can have 50 names but if they're all aggressive growth a lot of them are going to trade together in rotations like recently.  Last year you had an insanely great year for a number of sectors of the market, which largely only went up for months on end while meanwhile, other sectors were absolutely dealing with one of the worst periods they'd seen. Eventually - and it took a bit longer than I'd thought - too many people were on one side of the boat and some people started running to the other side.

In January on here it was ""How many Ark funds do you own?"" and ""I'm giving Cathy Wood all my money"" and then in February that reversed and rotations can really be very swift and brutal, especially after a year where Ark-ish growth outperformed as massively as it did.",dvdmovie1,8,/r/investing/comments/mvblxw/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gvb5ysj/,0.052,0.79,0.158,0.9984

95,TTD," If I tried to time every rotation like the one that's gone on in the last 1.5-2 months I'd probably create unnecessary stress, not time it well and I'd wind up selling positions where I have a low cost basis.

I started buying SHOP when it was double digits and I bought and sold and and bought and sold and at $300 I decided to just own it and stop trading in and out of it. I should have just owned it from the get go.

I buy things with the intent of owning long-term and I've been lucky to have been buying in December of 2018 and March 2020. If you have a low cost basis in things it's a lot easier to not be that phased by a correction. I own SE, which went from $280 to about $195 recently before bouncing back to about $240. My cost basis is substantially lower, so while the correction wasn't fun it didn't change my view and didn't really phase me much. If someone bought at $280, they're not thrilled. I think in a lot of cases with investing it's ""last one in first one out"" and the people who were late sell.

If you're buying something great in December of 2020, maybe it's not buying it in March 2020 when things were cratering, but you don't know that it won't look like a very good purchase in a year or two. If it's something great, what may seem like ""buying at a high"" may eventually seem far more appealing in retrospect.

The only time when I have really made a major overhaul was last year into early this year because I bought aggressive growth in March 2020 thinking that I'd be very happy in a year or two, only to luckily be right investing place/right investing time as those names took off for months on end. I thought the kind of performance in 2020 was definitely not sustainable, so gradual changes were made throughout the last half of last year and early this year. I had a very good 2020 but do I ever want to make that kind of overhaul again? Not really; I think I thought more about investing and particularly investing *decisions* last year than the prior three years combined. 

Optimally, for me I really don't want to feel like I have to make day-to-day decisions. I love researching and optimally the majority of investing time for me is looking for new ideas and keeping up with current holdings. I don't like feeling as if a lot of time has to be spent decision making. That doesn't mean no activity, but it's a tweak here and a tweak there. Overhauling a lot of my portfolio (still a good deal of aggressive growth, but less than before and a more concentrated group of names) worked out pretty well for the most part but isn't something I want to do again.

For me it's trying to identify appealing long-term stories and owning them, optimally long-term. If I own something 10 years, great because if I'm owning it 10 years it had to have done pretty well. Those may start off as small holdings and move up from the minors to the majors as an eventual large holding. Things like TTD, SE, SHOP, etc.

And maybe your time horizon/approach/etc are different and more short-term but personally I just think having a long term view and really trying to buy aggressively in December 2018/March 2020 situations (when the CNN Fear/Greed is like a 2; some people said it was briefly 0 in March 2020) is easier. Trying to buy and sell and buy and sell every time there's a correction/rotation I just think for most people leads to frustration.

Lastly, I think if you're all high growth then you can have 50 names but if they're all aggressive growth a lot of them are going to trade together in rotations like recently.  Last year you had an insanely great year for a number of sectors of the market, which largely only went up for months on end while meanwhile, other sectors were absolutely dealing with one of the worst periods they'd seen.

I wouldn't expect much from that sub.  It seems to be mostly memes and people yelling about things they haven't taken the time to understand.  At the very least I would be highly suspect of any subreddit that has mods actively promote this crap (just checked, the poster is a mod).  I mean this guy seems to be using this conspiracy stuff to boost his youtube channel, which seems to have the primary theme of ""how to make six figures in six months"".  So I guess this is the 2021 version of Tony Robbins explaining the intricacies of market mechanics, but on youtube, from what appears to be their dorm room, littered with stuffed emojis?  

The DTCC is just the entity that facilitates transfer of shares between buyers and sellers - because like obviously modern exchanges wouldn't be able to operate with the efficiency they do if we were still mailing paper stock certificates back and forth.  


All of this conspiracy shit started because the DTCC requires collateral for trades placed, to make sure buyers don't just place orders they can't pay for.  The higher risk the security the higher the collateral, it's a fairly straightforward relationship.  

When GME shot through the roof back in March the DTCC raised the collateral requirements, because there was all of the sudden a ton of risk on the table, it's a fairly normal thing to happen.  BUT because so many young people are trading with shitty upstart apps( Robinhood) rather than established brokers they encountered something unexpected - Robinhood (and others) didn't have the capital to meet the collateral call, so they just told people they couldn't buy GME anymore.  This obviously, and rightfully, pissed a ton of people off, but it's what you get for using a shitty broker. 

All of that said, there is this increasingly moronic movement that has decided that Occam's razor doesn't exist, so rather than just accept the very basic framework of ""Risk goes up -> Collateral goes up -> shitty broker can't afford to allow buys"" they have decided there is somehow a vast conspiracy of hedge funds and other institutions that stopped the poor little guy from trading because reasons.  

It's just a classic aversion to accepting responsibility - ""we don't want to admit we made a dumb choice by using a subpar broker, so therefore we must believe in an elaborate conspiracy.""",MasterCookSwag,6,/r/investing/comments/mvblxw/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gvcym1i/,0.166,0.77,0.064,-0.9944

110,UK," Hi, I’m 25yo from the UK. I am infull time employment earning approx £35k. I have £18k in a Stocks&Shares ISA with nearly the full £20k allowance for the current tax year available (also contributing £200pcm to a Help-to-buy ISA which reduces my S&S allowance to £17,600) and have around £60k from inheritance available to me (currently in trust). In the next 5 years I imagine I’ll be putting a significant chunk of this towards a deposit for a home, though I am not sure how much. 

Firstly, what’s the smart move with the £60k? I think it’s in a very low interest deposit account and I’d like to, at least, protect against inflation. Tax is my main concern here as I’d like to place £17,600 each tax year into my ISA to shield but don’t want to accrue much/any tax in the meantime. I also have a general trading account alongside my ISA which I can trade in. I get deep discounts on these accounts through work so transaction costs are very low. 

Secondly, I am very wary of an impending market crash and I am not knowledgable enough to invest in anything other than long equity and OEICs so wouldn’t want to short or anything too crazy. Are bonds too cautious?

111,TD," Looking for advice on brokers for margin loans, so I can dump money into one to borrow against stocks to get more returns.

I'm 31 in the US, earning 50-60k through employment, looking to eventually purchase a home whenever there's a chance (could be soon or the next few years). I'm fine with risk on money in excess of what's needed for my goals (if I get a property, I'm okay with getting margin called after). My only debt is student loans (24k), about 21k is federal so some may get canceled if Joe Biden ends up canceling federal student debt.

Living and working in Los Angeles, it's absurdly expensive to buy housing (I couldn't buy a 1 bedroom condo with 60k income last year, 50k in savings at the time, and an 800 credit score because I'm ""low income""). I've been putting my money into the stock market slowly and have 11k invested. I have about 55k more in savings and putting about 1k in weekly until I have only my emergency fund. Until I can afford to buy a place, I might as well have my money do something besides having inflation eat its value.

One idea I've heard about is using margin to make a down payment. From what I understand, because margin does not require a minimum payment, it isn't seen as debt in the eyes of mortgage lenders and often doesn't get their attention because they only consider the liquidation value of brokerage accounts. If the S&P 500 returns about 10% per year, getting a margin loan of 2-8% against those investments doesn't seem that bad. I understand that the market can drop and I can get margin called and be forced to sell; as long as I already got out of this rent trap I'm in, it's still a win for me.

Which brokers would have the best rates and would allow me to borrow the most from my portfolio? I have TD Ameritrade which lets me borrow half the value of my portfolio as cash, but at an 8.6-9.1% rate depending on how much I borrow. I have M1, which lets me borrow 35% at 3.5%, but the problem with that is that 35% of the 50k I'd want to eventually put in would not be enough for a down payment (I also prefer to actively manage my investments). Should I just stick with TD Ameritrade and see if they give me better rates after some time (already negotiated once) or is there a better brokerage for this?

119,DCF," You may learn different things from investing in individual stocks vs ETFs, but one thing you should be able to learn from studying is how market sectors behave.  at a macro level there is the cycle we are in (bull), the point in the cycle (last third of a really long bull IMO) and there are known things that win at this point of the cycle:  Mega Cap; Growth; the sectors that have won throughout the bull (US, tech, communications, health care), and late cycle winners like consumer discretionary (QQQ checks all those boxes).  Now all these things will change when the bear finally shows up, but it could be a while.  Learning about market sectors is good because even though there are individual stock opportunities in every sector, the ""winners keep winning"" is an important market truism - particularly at a sector level.

This leads to the next process which is unless you literally buy only the broad global index, you should be rebalancing your ETFs at least annually to match your expectations (now based on education!) for the best yearly opportunity.  if you put in a bunch of overweights, you would want to analyze at least quarterly and watch for macro changes.

This level of research and understanding is a lot easier to grab onto than the work to do a DCF analysis on an individual stock.

126,AG," Based on consensus analyst estimates, Largo is trading for just seven times 2021 gross earnings (EBITDA) and five times estimated 2022 EBITDA. And these estimates anticipate very little improvement in vanadium prices. So, if the vanadium price simply hangs on to its recent gains, Largo could book even larger profits.

Didn't want to make the post too long. But anyways. Here a lot of DD I have saved:

\----------------------------

""Despite the considerable operational and environmental virtues of VFRBs, they remain a relatively unknown energy storage solution. But they are beginning to emerge from obscurity... and to attract growing demand worldwide.

Currently, only about 100 VRFB installations are operating around the world. But the pace of new installations is gaining momentum worldwide. Most likely, that pace will ramp up even more as the entire energy storage market expands.

China, for example, is boosting its deployments of VFRBs. The image below shows a new 2 megawatt-hour (Mwh) solar-plus-VRFB project in China that has been in operation for two years.

Incidentally, this new forecast is *double* the forecast that Bloomberg New Energy Finance issued about two years ago.

To boost energy storage from where it is today to 741 Gwh by 2030 would require an annualized growth rate of nearly 40%.

VFRBs are likely to capture a growing share of this rapidly growing market... and Largo is well positioned to benefit from the trend.

Because Largo produces all of its revenues from vanadium mining, its share price tends to track closely with the vanadium price. A few years ago, that close connection caused Largo’s share price to skyrocket more than 1,000% – from $0.26 to $3.56 – in little more than a year.

  
But then the vanadium price came crashing back to Earth... and Largo’s share price followed. The good news is that Largo continues to produce solid profits, even with the current depressed vanadium prices.

The other good news is that the vanadium story is just beginning to attract attention from investors, thanks to its growing role as a “green element.”

Importantly, the steel industry consumes more than 90% of the annual global vanadium supply, leaving less than 10% for all other applications. So, it isn’t hard to imagine that additional demand from the energy storage sector could push the vanadium price higher.

Prior to the COVID pandemic, demand for vanadium had been trending higher. But the pandemic temporarily knocked the knees out from under the vanadium market.

Because of the crisis conditions, Largo posted modest losses during the first half of 2020. But the company returned to profitability in the second half of the year.

Thanks to a recovering steel market and to vanadium’s growing cachet as a “green element,” it should attract strong demand growth over the next few years, espe- cially if VRFBs gain market share as rapidly as I expect.

But Largo isn’t simply hanging around and waiting for the vanadium price to recover. For example, it is actively pursuing targeted value-added opportunities, like boosting its overall vanadium production, while also boosting its production of the high-purity vanadium that commands premium prices in the marketplace.

But it is Largo’s recent foray into the VRFB business that could be its most interesting and profitable value- added initiative.

**Going Clean**

Late last year, the company launched Largo Clean Energy, a new venture devoted to producing VRFBs. To kick off this new initiative, Largo spent $3.86 million in stock to acquire VRFB technology from VionX Energy, a company that has been involved in the renewable energy storage market since 2002.

As part of the acquisition, Largo obtained 12 patent families previously owned by VionX. Largo also onboarded VionX’s core technical team members, who collectively have decades of VRFB expertise.

This new venture will not contribute any major revenues or profits over the near term. But its long- term potential is as explosive as Wood Mackenzie’s growth estimates for the energy storage market.

As Largo CEO Paulo Misk stated on the company’s March 18 conference call:

*What we at Largo view as one of the most exciting advances of the company... is the launch of our Largo Clean Energy Division...*

*As we look forward to the future, Largo Clean* *Energy remains our particular focus as we* *work to commercialize our superior VCHARGE* *battery system to capitalize on long-duration energy storage opportunities around the world...*

*Global energy storage deployment is expected to reach a whopping 2,850 Gigawatts hours in 2040,* *and we believe long-duration, VRFB will play a* *critical role in addressing this significant demand.* *We remain very excited for this year ahead, as the company continues the necessary work to become a key player in the renewable energy industry.*

I don’t believe Largo’s stock price is even close to reflecting the company’s profit potential.

Based on consensus analyst estimates, **Largo is trading for just seven times 2021 gross earnings (EBITDA) and five times estimated 2022 EBITDA. And these estimates anticipate very little improvement in vanadium prices. So, if the vanadium price simply hangs on to its recent gains, Largo could book even larger profits.**

Interestingly, Largo announced two weeks ago that it would soon be hosting a “VRFB Day” for investors. This event is an obvious “knockoff” of the annual Battery Day event from Tesla Inc. (TSLA), which my **Volkswagen AG (VWAGY)** stock also mimicked recently.

As it turns out, such events can work wonders for a stock price. Two months after Tesla’s most recent Battery Day on September 22, the EV maker’s stock had soared more than 50%. Four months after the event, the stock had rocketed more than 100%.

Volkswagen’s March 15 “Power Day” achieved a similar feat. The automaker’s stock – which I added to our portfolio in February – popped more than 50% within three days of the event.

Perhaps Largo’s upcoming “VFRB Day” will deliver a similar share-price boost.

All-in, Largo shares offer a compelling play on a dynamic corner of the battery metals market. The company’s continuing success and rising profitability could propel its share price to significant gains over the next two or three years.",roccob7798,2,/r/investing/comments/mv4bij/out_of_the_250_stocks_i_own_this_mining_company/gv9z43q/,0.025,0.753,0.222,0.9997

Didn't want to make the post too long. But anyways. Here a lot of DD I have saved:

\----------------------------

""Despite the considerable operational and environmental virtues of VFRBs, they remain a relatively unknown energy storage solution. But they are beginning to emerge from obscurity... and to attract growing demand worldwide.

Currently, only about 100 VRFB installations are operating around the world. But the pace of new installations is gaining momentum worldwide. Most likely, that pace will ramp up even more as the entire energy storage market expands.

China, for example, is boosting its deployments of VFRBs. The image below shows a new 2 megawatt-hour (Mwh) solar-plus-VRFB project in China that has been in operation for two years.

Incidentally, this new forecast is *double* the forecast that Bloomberg New Energy Finance issued about two years ago.

To boost energy storage from where it is today to 741 Gwh by 2030 would require an annualized growth rate of nearly 40%.

VFRBs are likely to capture a growing share of this rapidly growing market... and Largo is well positioned to benefit from the trend.

Because Largo produces all of its revenues from vanadium mining, its share price tends to track closely with the vanadium price. A few years ago, that close connection caused Largo’s share price to skyrocket more than 1,000% – from $0.26 to $3.56 – in little more than a year.

  
But then the vanadium price came crashing back to Earth... and Largo’s share price followed. The good news is that Largo continues to produce solid profits, even with the current depressed vanadium prices.

The other good news is that the vanadium story is just beginning to attract attention from investors, thanks to its growing role as a “green element.”
