0,EM," I've grown to hate the idea against total market indexing, but I just recently reopened a position in VTI (not from cash, sold my small cap value etf in exchange). 

For the first time in a while I'd rather own the market than a factor bet. Not that Value doesn't have more outperformance to go from here...I still hold plenty of individuals in taxable, but I'm quite impressed that VTI was not flattened by the drop in Apple and other tech..shows how resilient it is.

5,GDP," Personal income is taxed, business income is taxed, and property is taxed. If consumer demand isn't there, then businesses aren't there, jobs aren't there, so tax revenue isn't there, and it spirals worse. Government spending must step in to prime the economy and get everyone motivated and able to contribute to national GDP and generate tax revenue. The national debt is huge, but it is nowhere near being a problem.

Think of it like borrowing to buy a car, where you stimulated your purchasing power but now you have equal debt. What would your life be like if you didn't have a car? Could you have the job you have today? Could you live where you do? How much time would be lost using other means of transportation?

At least, that's the old adage. On the other hand, I think this chain of logic often ignores or discounts business expansion potential that comes along with a booming economy (rising tides lift all boats, etc) that haven't been baked into short-/medium-term future earnings estimates.

Consider, PYPL, for instance. Rising interest rates would hurt *current* future earnings projections. But if there's a surge in demand for PYPL services, presumably due to the economic rebound, that goes *above and beyond* current management 
 guidance/analyst projections, then PYPL's stock would continue rising as future earnings are updated to reflect the new expansion.

13,ADP," Uh, yeah, that’s how sampling works. It would be highly inefficient to track every employee and would barely yield more reliable results. Btw, the BLS report is based on unemployment insurance claims, they don’t just ask nicely and say “okey dokey” to whatever a business says. 

Continuing unemployment claims have been falling pretty consistently. New claims, while a good indicator of the volatility of the job market, are not representative of overall unemployment numbers.

ADP tracks only 1/5 of private payroll. It is simply just another indicator, and you should never take one number as the gospel. The two surveys can differ, it’s natural when taking a sample using different datasets. The BLS uses a 90% confidence interval which is +/- 430,000 jobs. Continuing unemployment claims, BLS reports, ADP, labor participation rate, etc. should all be used in aggregate to determine the direction of employment in the country.

15,USA," Right, that is the conventional wisdom. But I don't think that's how it will play out in reality. Liquidity crises in international bond markets rarely happen overnight. It's probably going to be more of a slow crunch. Then the US will either raise taxes or it won't, spending will continue or it won't. 

A few things to keep in mind: a new industry in the USA could grow the economy enough to make our old debt meaningless. Healthy inflation does the same thing. 

And finally, when you look worldwide, debt has been increasing just about every country for centuries. If debts are promises, that's interesting. To me, it means we trust each other more, not less, in that we're willing to invest in each other.",mercenarypen,7,/r/investing/comments/mijlje/us_job_growth_accelerates_in_march_unemployment/gt52pmi/,0.058,0.818,0.125,0.8481

But some people are still jobless when their benefits run out, and many more are not eligible at all or delay or never apply for benefits. So, quite clearly, UI information cannot be used as a source for complete information on the number of unemployed.

23,FI," That's the plan right now.  The industry realizes they need people in the truck as security guards, and if a truck breaks down to handle it, so in the future when there are self driving trucks, most truck drivers will still have a job, but it will be near minimum wage.  I imagine even this will get phased out, but it's going to be decades from now.

So if you like the idea of sitting in a truck and doing nothing, and living by yourself in a cabin if you do multiday trips, and like the idea of stable pay, but at the same time making pennies (at least you might be able to find a way to not pay rent), then I'm sure there are going to be people to take companies up on that.

imo working on a ship is an alternative to truck driver.  Higher pay, out at sea for months at a time, so you don't have to worry about rent or living expenses.  Because you're out at sea you can probably register with a state with no income tax and pocket most everything you make.  It's great if you want to save up for a house or FI (financial independence, where passive investments make enough for you to live off of so you don't have to work).",proverbialbunny,12,/r/investing/comments/mijlje/us_job_growth_accelerates_in_march_unemployment/gt5hzt1/,0.032,0.835,0.133,0.9773

25,UPS," Sure I am a tech guy as much as anyone, but the reality is far different.  Also, it depends on the type of product being transported, and where it is being transported to.  Someone like UPS, Fedex, or some other LTL company that is moving freight from one terminal to another terminal, yeah that won't be hard to automate.  But what about longer runs?  Who is going to fuel the truck daily? Who is going to do the mandatory pre-trip or post-trip inspection that is required by the federal government, before each trip? Who is going to be responsible for mechanical issues or breakdowns?  Do shippers really want to ship on a truck that has no human presence to deal with any potential issues that come up?  If there is a break down, are they going to want their freight on the side of the road with no human presence? What about flatbed freight?  The driver is responsible for securing, tarping, etc.  The driver must then recheck whatever is used to secure the load, ie straps, chains, etc after loading within 50 miles, and then every 150 miles or 3 hours, for the duration of the trip.  These are not impossible hurdles to overcome, but it's far more difficult then just have the truck being able to ""stay on the highway."" These are only a few of the literally hundreds of questions that have to be answered and dealt with before full automation.  Full automation will include an entire revamp of the current logistics system as those questions are answered.",asianperswayze,5,/r/investing/comments/mijlje/us_job_growth_accelerates_in_march_unemployment/gt5gp0w/,0.034,0.868,0.099,0.9324

33,ICE," Deliveries up 109% and production up 76% YoY. And they even beat the previous record Q4. Beats analyst estimates from Factset of 168k (ranging from 145-188k) despite major headwinds. 

The major headwinds were Tesla produced 0 S/X in Q1 due to updated Model changeover in the Fremont factory, Q1 is typically seasonally weak for automakers, global chip parts and shipping shortages, rumors (now confirmed in Biden infrastructure plan) about the expired US tax credit being renewed for Tesla which pulled demand out into the future, and Chinese New Year shutdown production and deliveries in China for 1-2 weeks. 

Given these facts, Tesla further ramping Model Y in China and starting Model S/X production again and fewer headwinds overall should allow Q2 to exceed 200k units production/delivery. Then Tesla has factories in Berlin and Austin starting production in Q3, which should allow overall production and deliveries for 2021 to exceed 900k and possibly reach Elon Musk’s stretch target of 1 million (Tesla’s official guidance was a vague >750k). This would mean Tesla could expand their BEV market share from 23% in 2020 to 23-30% in 2021 (based on projections for BEV market to grow 50-70% this year). All this despite increasing “competition”.

40,IMO," Is there potential for a larger collapse in the next few decades? Yes. Is it certain? Absolutely not.

My strategy is to invest primarily in ”essentials”: a home and land in a safe location.

Once that is close to sorted, I dabble with stocks and other investments with money that I can afford to lose if markets crash. There’s still some upside in the near future. And let’s be honest, even your cash sitting on your digital account won’t be safe if the feared big crash comes about.

We are fucked. There is no way around this. And nothing is getting done, and nothing will be done. Here are 3 charts showing the same thing, the history of our ""talking"" about climate change and the actual ""walking"" we do:

And that's just CO2. Then there is a [methane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_methane), which ""traps 84 times more heat per mass unit than CO2"". And guess what, it also continues to rise

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Atmospheric_Concentrations_of_Methane_Over_Time.png

Just look at those graphs. We have fucked up the atmosphere, the air we breathe, the air we can't live without. And we continue doing so. And it continues to heat up the planet.

Here is a graph of the Arctic sea ice levels: https://i.redd.it/uvvtnsyiz1n51.jpg

And guess what happens when there is no ice? The same thing that happens with your drink when the ice cubes melt - it starts to heat up much faster, since the ice was the temperature balancing counterweight that didn't let the drink heat up. It was the ""temperature reserve"". It was our ""rainy day savings pot"". And we are blowing straight through it.

And that's just a tip of the iceberg, not even touching on the extermination of nature we are doing, the biodiversity loss, the oceans acidification, the loss of wildlife, fish in the oceans, forests, soil erosion and land degradation, food/water crises, the list is HUGE. And they are all connected and feed off each other:  https://i.imgur.com/UpyzgVM.jpg

Not going to make this a huge post with all the details, head over to /r/collapse if you care and not afraid to face reality. There is just no way around the fact that the resources on our planet are finite and are running out. And we continue to demand more and more from it, harvest more resources, dig up more rocks and oils, all while breeding like rabbits.

> at least humanity is mainly on the same side, as opposed to previous global crises and wars.

This is just plainly misleading. We are either on the same side of ""let's ignore it because it means we need to give up our stuff and desires"" - which doesn't lead to doing anything. Or we are on different sides where developed countries (West) is going to attempt to do something about the climate catastrophe while the developing world will continue to ramp up their pollution because ""now is our turn"": https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-56596200

To OP: I am almost the same age as you and at this point I view investing only as a way of increasing my life standard at later point when everything will be worse. It's not to make it great, but to make it less worse. Because the capitalism system will be ditching the poor and the working first. 

The future will not look like ""hey stock market collapsed and Bezos/Musk stocks are now worthless"". That would just mean that rich people would lose almost everything, while the poor would not lose anything at all. And that's not how our civilization operates. A more realistic scenario I think would look something like this: Imagine what happens if all the prices rise today tenfold, inflation adjusted. In that situation, do you want to have more money? Yes, because it's still the way you pay for things. You just can't buy as many things as you could previously. And this is why I continue investing, because the system will do everything it can to prop up the wealthy for as long as possible.",UpAndDownArrows,-13,/r/investing/comments/mig57o/investing_w_climate_change_on_the_horizon/gt4qs69/,0.094,0.855,0.051,-0.9788

If you believe the doomsday scenarios then figure out how to express that thesis in your investments. ie short Miami muni bonds, agricultural derivatives, insurers and reinsurance, inland property, seawall companies, etc etc. Make a killing off the science deniers and clueless actuarials. 

Whenever I suggest this people immediately weasel away from their doomsdaying because the conviction never matches the rhetoric.

You can just read the first page of the [Green New Deal](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/109/text) to see what the expected economic damages are from the top intergovernmental agencies:

If you're getting shaken out by a possible 2.5% GDP disruption after 80 years of economic growth (which you could possibly profit off of with some smart overweights) you shouldn't be investing.

54,AI," The case of ARK Invest is a very interesting case.

ARK is very transparent, which is nice to investors. But that transparency can reveals your secrets and flaws.  So, they have really believe what they do and are supremely confident to be that transparent.

ARK has been historically criticized by many and yet, they have outperformed most.

At the same time, many of these criticisms, including this one, are guaranteed.  I watched their video promotions of two areas Genomics and AI (two areas that I have good knowledge of), and came away unimpressed with their technical assessments.  Their comments on Genomics and AI technologies are very superficial; they sound like they came from someone whose research on the topics are based on simple web searches.

Even of topics that I do not know much technically, I still don't quite see eyes to eyes with Cathie Woods.  A few years ago, she said in the near future people would no longer own cars; there would just be self-driving cars driving back and forth on demand. Well, it hasn't happened, and even then, I never believed that.  There's something about human psychology of ownership and given so much cultures involving owning cars, that I don't believe Cathie's vision will be realized any time soon.

Another thing about ARK Invest is their love of using the word ""Exponential"".  Exponential growth. Exponential this. Exponential that. We see Exponential opportunities here and there. That's a good company, but it's not Exponential.

For the lack of better words, these sound quite bullshit. Exponential growth does not exist in a technical sense.  Further, it's not necessary a good thing when you have exponential growth.  When you grow exponentially, you'll destroy your own knees and eventually collapse on your own damn weight.

Another very important thing that bothers me is their claim of using Wright's Law as the foundation of the investment strategies.  I don't think that ARK's success has much to do with Wright's Law. I think their success is based on their ability to trade days in days out -- thanks to their transparency, we know this.",patriot2024,18,/r/investing/comments/mij0s2/arkk_morningstar_review_unrestrained_unaware_and/gt5ddsa/,0.082,0.776,0.141,0.9693

Tesla's current TTM revenue is $31.5 billion.

Keep in mind that Uber's (taxis) current revenue is only $11 billion and Progressive's (auto insurance) revenue is $42.6 billion. These projections are completely based on wishful thinking and divorced from reality, but necessary for them to contiune investing in Tesla, which is their ""highest conviction"" stock.

Look up Robert Kearns and his intermittent windshield wiper, if you want to see how big auto does business. All that really needs to happen is for all the fueling stations to go with a proprietary coupling that is only licensed to GM and Ford, etc, and cut Tesla out. If big oil, and big auto, decide to work together to solve the refueling problem with long trips, it will be their market.

e.g: there are over 2.5 BILLION android devices in the world. all collecting data for GOOGL. google knows when you drive, ride a bike or walk. and they also know how many people around you do the same thing. 

how many people use chrome and google maps on their iphone again ?   
I know nobody that uses apple maps. guess what google maps does..

117,UK," I am moving from UK to the US and considering which investment platform to use. I'm 30 years old, making c.$150k and looking to invest semi-actively with a long-term time horizon.

I'm interested in some of the newer 'social' trading & research platforms (e.g., Public, Commonstock, Doji), but feel a little uneasy fully sharing my financial information. Potentially just me being v British about it.

What do others think of these platforms & fully disclosing their financial positions in general?",Serious_Outside9153,3,/r/investing/comments/migerh/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gt4ldg9/,0.037,0.892,0.07,0.3886
118,AMAT,"  TL:DR - looking for feedback on a simple hi return stock screen and thoughts on how to rank results.

Early 60's, simple, diversified, buy and hold retirement portfolio approach my whole life. Looking at working probably another 5-10 years and starting to get a lot more active in my portfolio. Nothing crazy and I'm fundamentally a conservative+ investor, but I do not subscribe to moving 100% into ultra safe right before retirement. Portfolio size is low 7 figure for reference.

Over the past few months I subscribed to a couple of authors on Seeking Alpha and have tried out a few strategies with minimal exposure and have a good idea of how to use some of the approaches in my portfolio. I want to develop my own screens because at least on Seeking Alpha, the authors I've found charge a small monthly fee for their updates. It's nothing huge, and for me at least has been worth seeing their approaches, but nothing I want to pay for the rest of my life.

I'm going to put together a dividend screen/strategy and a ""better than cash"" parking lot strategy. Pretty basic and straightforward. I also just got started on putting together a screen to identify a more hi growth strategy - thought being on a monthly basis invest in the top 4 stocks that fall out of the screen. Would love some feedback on the screen (I'm stock knowledgeable, but certainly not an expert). When looking at the screen and giving feedback keep in mind my objective: not looking for the perfect approach or for mega returns, I'm an 80/20 kinda guy so looking for a decent, simple to execute strategy to reliably give back a growth-class return. (And using the Fidelity screener as that's where my portfolio is).

Screen as it stand currently:

* Tagging Energy, Health Care, Financials, Information Technology and Industrials sectors
* Market cap down to Medium (as defined by Fidelity: 6-33B)
* 13 week price performance down to 13%
* 3 yr annualized Beta of 1.1 and up (conflicted on whether this really helps the screen)
* Very Bullish or Bullish analyst recommendations (Summary score from StarMine)
* Forward EPS 3-5 yrs high to very high (16.5% and up)
* EPS growth Projected year versus last year high to very high (40% and up)

As an example, running that screen today resulted in a list of 7 stocks (sorry not allowed to link image or would give you a shot of the fundamentals):

1. AMAT - Applied materials
2. FANG - Diamondback Energy
3. EOG - EOG Resources
4. NXPI - NXP SemiConductor
5. KKR - KKR & Co
6. LRCX - LAM Research Corp
7. MU - Micron Technology

So the thought would be to run this first day of every month and put a set amount in the top 4 stocks in the filter. I would guess some stocks might stay in for months, some might rotate in and out quickly.

My question is basically around how to rank. So do I just pick a screening metric (or some other metric) and do a simple rank on that metric to determine top 4, or do I create a formula to weight and aggregate multiple metrics into an overall score and rank on that?

128,ATH," I desperately need help. I can't stop trying to time the market. I know i shouldn't do it but I'm getting nailed by sunk cost fallacy and my emotions. 

I started ""investing"" by buying 10k in market ETFs back in the beginning of 2018. I had 40k available but saw that everything was ATH so i bought in with only 10k. That was my first mistake in trying to time the market. Wanted to buy the rest when the market dipped and it did dip in December but i was busy with life so didn't even watch the markets. The 30k cash sat in my brokerage account at 0% interest until March of last year. When i saw everything crash my plan to buy went outside the window. I saw how everything was falling more and more day and day out and got greedy. Not only did i not buy in i instead with short with a 3x leveraged inverse ETF which i bought at the literal bottom on March 23rd with 10k. Then everything started going back up and because of sunk cost fallacy on the inverse ETF I did not even think to go long; kept waiting for the market to dip again so i can get rid of the short. Come September, my parents tells me that their 2% MER mutual fund was down and they're paying such high fees annually. I had the genius idea to swap their mutual funds out for low cost index funds that mirrored the allocation. The idea was sound but i again got hit by my market timing tendencies. I did not buy into the ETFs after selling the mutual funds, i kept thinking the market will dip and I would buy back in when its cheaper. The market did gradually dip but i did not buy in because i thought it would fall further, guess i learnt nothing from March. November came and the market just kept shooting up and I still felt it was unjustified so i still did not go in and I am still in cash to this day. I did buy back in 2 weeks ago after the fed announcement but the market dipped 1.5% the day after and i got scared and sold it again when the market recovered to where i bought it at and now its up another 2% since i sold it. 

&#x200B;

All because of of my sheer stupidity i lost out on more than 70k profits from last year and when i finally sold the inverse ETF in February i realized 8k in actual losses. I make 40k a year so this is 2 years of my salary and most likely more than 5+ years of appreciation. This was such a expensive lesson yet I learnt absolutely nothing and I'm still trying to time the market. I have been depressed since November and keep telling myself to stop trying to time the market and just buy in but I never do. I keep looking back at what could of been and tell myself to wait for another dip so I can at least buy back a bit cheaper. When the market does dip i however never buy because I want it to go down even further. I am making every mistake in the book when it comes to investing; my emotions are trumping my logic and it is preventing me from moving forward. 

&#x200B;

I desperately need some help. I want to get back into the market but I see how high everything is right now and i hesitate. The spy went up 40% in 4 months since November and I feel bearish but it just keeps on going up. I had so many opportunities since November to buy dips but i never did and my mind just can't comes to terms with buying back in at a higher price than when i sold it. I know reading my story will make some people angry, I myself can't believe how some one as retarded as i am could exist. The market was literally giving away free money last year yet i was able to incur a loss. I feel like absolutely shit that I just had to make this kinda of massive mistake in the strongest bull market in history.",ClosetPervy,1,/r/investing/comments/migerh/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gt55ybu/,0.094,0.851,0.055,-0.9779

131,USA," I've been lurking on the sub for several weeks, reading the sidebars, the articles posted, the finance news here and other sites. So I think I've developed a decent enough understanding to start asking Qs: 

Spouse and I are 35 and 45 living in Arizona, USA. We earn combined about $8K a month and we save about $3K of that income every month (more if you count pension but keeping this simple). Our only debt is a $200K mortgage we just refi'd to 2.75 on an estimated $550K house. 

We don't have any experience in investment. I have $13K in a Fidelity Freedom 2040 plan which was an old matching 401 that I haven't put anything in to in 5 years and is fine.

Our savings is really why we're interested in investing. we're about to reach $100K in savings and other than an upcoming kitchen remodel, we don't have any major expenses. Kitchen estimate is \~$30K. 

I'd like to start buying either individual stocks in something we want to see succeed like renewable energy or a portfolio that would include emerging environmental tech or biopharmaceuticals to start with. 

We'd be willing to gamble $2K on this initial investment. And we are curious to learn what sort of payoff expectation that \*might\* generate by April 2022? At which point, we'd re-evaluate.

132,IMO," It always makes sense until it doesn’t and no one wants to get rich slowly.

IMO pull out a little and put a downpayment on a condo that you envision yourself living in or can at least rent out in the interim.

Ie, diversify your income streams into more passive income. Stocks (esp crypto) are high beta investments - they will be the first to fall leaving you little opportunity to scoop up other investments at good prices.

$140k NW seems a lot at 23 with limited responsibilities; it’s not much as you get to 30.

133,RFP," Buy raw supply and hoard it in your house. Or find a company that produces whichever commodity you’re looking for and invest in them. Pretty generic advice but that’s pretty much it, aside from etfs anyway.

For example I went with RFP for my lumber investment, which is pretty risky cause that’s it for lumber in my portfolio lol.

135,RSI," The market is forward looking, not backward. What happened last year only matters for charts, barely.

If you want to time the market, learn RSI and MACD. They will show you the big trends so you can avoid buying when stocks are overbought or in a long term downtrend. The best time to buy is when a stock stabilized and is shifting to an uptrend, which the indicators help you figure out.

Make a list of your high conviction stocks long term. Add them to your watchlist and look for a good opportunity to buy. You're going to find patterns and since you're going to be following those stocks you're going to know before other investors when they're a good buy.",PatrickDesjardins,2,/r/investing/comments/migerh/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gt5fove/,0.019,0.843,0.138,0.9212
