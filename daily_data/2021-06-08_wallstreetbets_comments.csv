201,GME," So first of all, fuck the bot accounts that come in and just spam tickers. You hate them, we hate them.

We do a lot to prevent them, but any detection method we put out can just be circumvented as soon as they find out. 

We ultimately rely on Reddit Admins to deal with spammers, ban evasion, etc.  They're the ones with detailed user info. They're the ones who can see the technical details we can't, and can stop spam before its ever visible.

Yesterday I banned a user who was posting ""BB to the moon"" every 6 seconds. Luckily automod was already catching all their comments, but if Reddit Admins can't even catch that, then you can only imagine what more sophisticated spammers will try. -- Anyways, I'll leave it up to you to guess how I feel about their performance thus far.

Second, we *did* have a GME megathread yesterday, and even with that, there were very few comments about GME on it. I even posted [yesterday midday](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nu8o4x/daily_popular_ticker_thread_for_june_07_2021_bb/h0wxmhl/?context=3) that it was not being discussed enough to make it to today's thread.

[We took your feedback](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nse1dg/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of_june/h0owpty/?context=3) and decided that we shouldn't be the ones picking which stocks get a megathread. 

**You the users decide**.

If there's not enough people discussing GME (or any other stock), do you really want us to step in and force a megathread on it anyways? No, that would be unfair.

What we *can* do, is allow a megathread when there's a special event (E.g. Earnings) for a very highly discussed stock, which is what we're doing tomorrow for GME, as announced yesterday and the day before.

---

As for daily megathreads for each stock, honestly, we tried that before, and although these might be different times, back then it blew up into everyone fighting one another, and one thread being highly upvoted while the rest were downvoted into oblivion. 

That's not a good experience for anyone who isn't in the hivemind, and that's a level of echo chamber we ultimately want to avoid.

---

Please let me know any suggestions you have, always happy to talk about how we can improve.

We ultimately rely on Reddit Admins to deal with spammers, ban evasion, etc.  They're the ones with detailed user info. They're the ones who can see the technical details we can't, and can stop spam before its ever visible.

Yesterday I banned a user who was posting ""BB to the moon"" every 6 seconds. Luckily automod was already catching all their comments, but if Reddit Admins can't even catch that, then you can only imagine what more sophisticated spammers will try. -- Anyways, I'll leave it up to you to guess how I feel about their performance thus far.

Second, we *did* have a GME megathread yesterday, and even with that, there were very few comments about GME on it. I even posted [yesterday midday](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nu8o4x/daily_popular_ticker_thread_for_june_07_2021_bb/h0wxmhl/?context=3) that it was not being discussed enough to make it to today's thread.

[We took your feedback](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nse1dg/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of_june/h0owpty/?context=3) and decided that we shouldn't be the ones picking which stocks get a megathread. 

**You the users decide**.

If there's not enough people discussing GME (or any other stock), do you really want us to step in and force a megathread on it anyways? No, that would be unfair.

What we *can* do, is allow a megathread when there's a special event (E.g. Earnings) for a very highly discussed stock, which is what we're doing tomorrow for GME, as announced yesterday and the day before.

---

As for daily megathreads for each stock, honestly, we tried that before, and although these might be different times, back then it blew up into everyone fighting one another, and one thread being highly upvoted while the rest were downvoted into oblivion. 

That's not a good experience for anyone who isn't in the hivemind, and that's a level of echo chamber we ultimately want to avoid.

Please let me know any suggestions you have, always happy to talk about how we can improve.

If they're forced to cover shorts at current price/float, it'll boom. The concern I personally have with GME is that the SEC will step in and broker a deal between hedge funds on both sides of the bet to avoid a market crash - even at the current price, hedgefunds will go bankrupt and no one's going to be able to buy all these $300 shares. AMC is still within a realistic scenario. But I'm too lazy to do the DD - I plan to exit GME before the height of the squeeze to avoid bagholding. If I miss out on it, I'm okay with that.

I sold nearly all of my AMC for a 250% profit. It could have been more a week later. But my WKHS is up, and seems to be a hold, while my SOFIW is on the rise again. I’m not sophisticated enough to do a deep dive into stocks, although I do read other’s deep dives.

584,CLOV," You pay a price for the ability(but not the obligation, as in, you don’t have to) to buy(or sell, if you’re doing puts instead of calls) 100 shares at a certain price. So at the end of the contract, you get the option to buy a ton of shares at(potentially) a discount, if the current price of the stock is above the “locked in” price at the time of the option expiring.

The confusing part I think to most people is that you can sell this ability at any time. You dont have to wait for it to expire. So if I bought the ability(or option) to purchase 10k shares of CLOV for $15 (expiring july) a few weeks ago, I’d be rolling in money right now. Even if my option was for $30, if you looked at the price a few weeks ago and said “what are the odds CLOV hits $30” you’d say it was very low. Today? That’s now crazy, but reasonable, so a $30 call option expiring next week is worth a lot more today than it was a month ago.

1272,PT," Not stupid, I didn't know it for awhile. 

People will see the high price in premarket and want to take profits at open so you will see a lot of sell off right at open. 
If you buy at open, you'll be paying a huge premium over what it will likely drop to after a few minutes. I wait till the downward trend has stopped and buy in then.

To know when it's done going down I generally I look at the previous close. If it has a very strong pre-market, people who didn't hit their PT in the open market the day before will want to take their money at open so they will sell. Which makes sense. However, if my price target is $5 PPS and last night it closed at $5, wouldn't I most likely have sold yesterday? 

So I look for the price to slope sharply down at open and expect it to visually level off around last night's close. If it keeps its sharp downward movement past the previous close, I generally want to wait and see what happens. If it keeps diving then stops at say $4.25 then starts trending back up, I jump in then. If it keeps diving and doesn't stop, I check the news to see what I missed.

You may end up watching it continue upward, which is unlikely. But it will almost certainly dip again later in the day and I would rather buy in later than buy in at open just to watch it drop 10% immediately.",mochmeal2,57,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nv30za/clov_pre_market_volume_already_25_million_and_up/h10u0vq/,0.034,0.897,0.069,0.6235

1277,CLOV," Shorts just don't have one in / out point. There are many shorts, with a huge range of liquidity ranges. They jump in and out at different times. So some of the earlier shorts may have closed out, some will open positions now, some will enter positions in the future.

Some of the larger shorts with big liquidity won't care about losing money in the short term becuase they think that, in the end, the share price will dump. They will probably cover their short posiitions anyway, so might not lose any money in the short term.

No matter what the current share price, or how many WSB apes are hyping up the stock, a crazy rally always attracts shorts becuase they always think it will drop at some point, so they try and hold out longer than the apes.

This meme stock frenzy has been an absolte goldmine for hedge/investment funds - some of them have made obscene profits off the back of these rallies, wether they are short or long of the stocks. Of course some have lost big, but some are seeing far bigger returns than in the past.

In the end it boils down to money and greed, they want to make as much money as possible, and so do we.

We're running a GME Earnings Megathread tomorrow...

I don't want to split the discussion, and I think you guys don't want that either. 

Should we make an exception and exclude GME from the most popular ticker thread if it makes it in, while keeping the GME earnings megathread?

So, it would be possible for a kinetic energy to cause collisions on these molecules, producing a very low quality sound wave not understandable with human ear. Also, space isn't a perfect vacuum. In our solar system, space is filled with a thousand atoms per cubic meter. That's why even traveling 20% light speed is a danger to nano craft hence why they need to send so many. Surely some will be destroyed by the stray atoms making their way to a distant world.

2016,CLOV," TLDR: because the implied volatility of options on CLOV spiked today, options premiums are now worth more.

When you sell a call, you collect the options premium (which spiked today) from the call buyer , in exchange for an agreement to sell the shares at the strike price (in my case, it's $22)

So selling $22 covered calls against my shares is not only an effective hedge, but also very profitable if CLOV does not go above $22.

If by 6/18 CLOV is

\- below $22: I hold onto my shares and collect the options premium. (best case)

\- at $22: I sell my shares at $22

\- Above $22: I sell my shares at $22

It is called ""covered calls"" because my shares cover the risk of the option contracts I sell. My shares are the underlying.

&#x200B;

**some more info**

Option premiums = the value of an option contract.

Why did options premiums skyrocket today?

TLDR: gamma squeeze and a spike in implied volatility

**Simplified:** a premium is the  function of an option contract's delta (CLOV's stock price) theta (time-decay: option contracts are worth less as we move closer to the strike date), and Implied volatility (market makers ""price in"" expected moves and offer contracts for sale with an implied volatility to reflect their beliefs). There is also gamma: the rate of change or first derivative  of delta.

So a sharp increase in the expected volatility of CLOV means market makers are now selling CLOV contracts at a significantly higher price. Premiums are worth more, so it is more profitable to sell.",dliu1,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nv3nwi/clov_short_seller_numbers_and_gamma_squeeze_info/h11drw0/,0.026,0.83,0.144,0.9849

In order to save fleets money, Hyliion developed a hybrid solution so that fleet owners can keep their current fleets and convert them to hybrids using RNG to fuel them.  The second solution that Hyliion has developed is the Hypertruck ERX in partnership with Peterbuilt.  You'l also want to Google the ERX Council. Here is a link for your convenience.

I’m sure there are bots here, but on the whole it does not seem overrun with bots. When I look at post histories I don’t see much evidence of bots. The karma requirements help a bit there too. I’m happy to be persuaded if you can provide some analysis.

There is no need for a firm like Susquehanna or Citadel to engage in the type of bot/data mining activity you are describing. There are already others data mining, and Citadel and Susquehanna are already getting the order flow, which is a million times more useful than just spamming with bots.

To summarize: Citadel and Susquehanna do not have strong directional bets in these names, the 13F’s don’t say that, so that’s at best your opinion. They are not placing bots here, others could be - but you haven’t sized the bots - as a user I don’t get the impression that WSB is overrun with bots. You present no data to back up any of your claims other than a 13F, which doesn’t say anything material. I’m sorry but I’m not inclined to believe you that Citadel and Susquehanna are flooding this page with bots in the hopes of pumping and dumping CLOV.",FakeNewsIgnorer,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nuole1/go_clov_dont_miss_the_rocket_to_the_moon/h104w07/,0.075,0.789,0.136,0.9557

They are adding up to 5% of their shares at today’s price.  With price targets north of $20, this would only really adjust the target to $19 IF all the shares dumped today.  Keep in mind that the shares are not going into the market today with the announcement.

2620,BB," My guess is like I said 50-80 in this current cycle and then a pull back. Completely depends on what the biggest investors/whales want to do. Generally they like getting a new set of folks to buy at the top before the pullback. My guess is that is going to be high 70s to 80s before a rug pull back to 20s-30s for a new accumulation phase. No way those big boys aren't going to sell a majority of the stock at the highs, let it get nailed by shorts, and then buy it back and rinse and repeat. After a pull back from new all time highs in the 70-80s then it may take till the end of the year to rebuild back to 50-80. I'm guessing somewhere between mid-2022 and mid-2023 that BB will be regularly above a 100.",willadair,19,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nuou81/where_can_bb_make_it_too_besides_the_moon/h0yowny/,0.016,0.926,0.059,0.5994

2632,BB," You got a point here. I'm feeling that BB is going down for the next week because boomers are being suggested by seeking alpha's bullshit.

2633,BB," Not most boomers, certainly casual investors, but mostly just short traders. Those baloney articles do scare many casual investors. Look at BB today. 1.25 point move up to 17.17 but the shorts just shot it back down to a basically flat trade day at 15.84. How many are going to buy at 16-20 and sell at 16-17? Only those that really don't believe in the stock.

The shorts traders want  the price to of course to drop down back to single digits. Yet the price essentially held and advanced on the day. Why? Because the big guys are prepping it for the next big move up by buying low and waiting to sell at new highs. They have time on their side. 

The price may consolidate sideways which honestly isn't a bad thing at all. Considering we are trading at double the start of the year and double the most recent test lower. If we keep a double up method going then that puts bb eventually in the 32s, 64s, and 128s. Look at TSLA's wild swings up and back then it repeats. I wouldn't be surprised if that happens with BB.

The crazy thing is the number of people who don't get that this is all just priming the pump. Why would the big guys buy a million for 30 bucks a share when they can buy it at 15 and then pump it up and sell it at 30. 

I like accumulation. When the big moves happens, you're ready for the action.",willadair,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nuou81/where_can_bb_make_it_too_besides_the_moon/h12ohs2/,0.071,0.832,0.098,0.7541

2682,UWMC, This is about as safe a bet as you can make in the market. I have 5K shares @ $7.40 and will buy more if it dips to 8.50. I bought into CLOV this morning for a 1K shares at 14.25 and sold at 21.25.. quick 7K gain that will go into UWMC. I fully expect this stock to pop to $12-$14 per share in the next couple of month.

2844,GME," I think what OP is stating is that people were selling things that they didn't actually have, nor could GUARENTEE that they WOULD have, at Time of Sale.

It would be like if I said ""Hey, can I borrow $5? I'll pay you back on Friday!"" 
You, without actually having the money said, ""Sure! But instead, you'll repay me $6, and I'll give it to you tomorrow!"" And then went out and asked a friend ""can I borrow a couple bucks?"" because you don't actually have $5. But, you do not know for certain that your friend will loan you the dinero, but you still promised to loan me $5. 

It was like that, but then your friend said ""okay!"", but then had to borrow from HIS friend. GME stocks were just a series of HF ""borrowing"" stock that they didn't have possession of for the purpose to loan them out to an extra party. 

I could be wrong, but that's how I read it. If anyone has more insight, go for it.

2850,NOK," It's a contract to buy 100 shares at a set price at a set time. You pay a premium per share for this contract. Purchased calls (and puts I believe - less experience) do not have to be exercised at expiry, but can be to purchase or sell the 100 shares at the agreed strike price. If at expiry whether the price is above or below (depending on call or put) the strike price plus the premium per share will determine its value. So, if the strike price was $10 and the premium $.50 you'd need the share price to get to $10.50 by expiry for you to break even (on a call). I believe it would be strike minus premium for put, so $9.50. Anything above or below these points depending on call or put is profit. 


Now, something important to remember. That premium flexes with share price. And, it can flex A LOT. In regard to premiums, it's just like shares prices. Higher it goes the better. So, the call I bought this morning, for example, was $.35 per share for the premium. At close, the premium was $.975 per share. I expect it to be are $1.25 at open, depending on premarket. So, in one day that's 278% profit from open to close. Could be around 400% open to open. I won't have the capital to exercise these, so instead I'll share the contract for that higher premium. 

For more traditional options, look into delta, beta, and gamma ok investopedia to get a bit of an idea. 

If you want to some experience, which is what I recommend, buy some OTM soon to expire cheap calls. 7/11 NOK $7 would be good. It will likely be around $5-10 tomorrow at open and might even make you some money. Take a few shots with cheap options like that to get a feel. 

Hope this helps. Good luck, retard.",tragiktimes,18,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nuwuud/clov_yolo_cause_options_are_fun/h1035u3/,0.035,0.748,0.216,0.9965

Your risk tolerance is wild enough for you to be here. You will get through this. Take a break and come back fresh. Don’t chase your losses. Talk to some comrades here about how dumb your plays were. If you still feel like you can’t handle life; check out the resources below. There’s no shame in reaching out. My inbox is always open as well, though response time may vary. Worst case, there’s always bankruptcy, and even that isn’t the end of the world.

3362,CLOV," In my experience when absolutely everyone thinks something is going to happen, Eg. CLOV gamma squeeze. It typically doesn’t… leaving everyone wondering why it didn’t. The run from 6s to where it is now was pretty low key. People couldn’t give a shit about CLOV posts for the last 2 weeks. I’m gonna take the buy the fear sell the greed route. I also left 70k on the table by selling this morning so I’ve got absolutely no idea what I’m doing.
