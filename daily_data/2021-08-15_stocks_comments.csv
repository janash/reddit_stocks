0,NVDA, I think NVDA will beat estimates and the stock will sell off a bit to $180.  Let's not forget that NVDA just went up 60% in 3 months.  I don't expect another large move so soon after.,Mordrim,227,/r/stocks/comments/p4u3ud/nvidia_earnings_coming_up_on_monday/h91e9ni/,0.0,0.951,0.049,0.1695
1,NVDA," Does NVDA have long term growth potential? Absolutely. 

Is it going to skyrocket with earnings coming up like it did before the split? No, lol.

12,NVDA," To answer your question: NVDA has been demonstrating the classic signs of a bull flag the last week. If you broaden out the chart a little wider, it’s showing the signs of a cup and handle pattern. Both of these are bullish signs. Friday was potentially the start of a breakout, but there’s strong resistance at around $206. If it breaks above that resistance, you can probably expect it to jump quite a bit. 

An investment firm (I can’t remember which one) upgraded their price target to $245. If we examine the options market, there was an unusually large, bull call sweep at $245, which suggests a whale out there is VERY confident in a steep rise in price in the near term. 

That said, the stock market is completely random in the short term. It moves like a drunk searching for his keys by lamplight.

14,AMD," All Nvidia has is GPU. Literally. And GPUs don't work without CPU. AMD is the dark horse that's going to eat Nvidia's lunch next like they did with Intel.

ARM marketshare even today is only 1-2% to x86's 97% (in datacenter, according to a recent report). And now AMD adds FPGA to the mix (via Xilinx). AMD will have the: best CPU, best GPU (chiplet GPU on TSMC), and best adaptive computing (Xilinx is #1 in FPGA).

Also both Intel and AMD are going after Nvidia for the first time ever (they can push Nvidia out any market since they have the x86 CPU). I doubt Nvidia will keep their leadership by 2026. Nvidia has already lost technical leadership to AMD in some metrics. RDNA2 > Ampere for gaming.

24,AMD," Yes.. the only reason Nvidia can be present in premium laptops is because until recently they were the only game in town. Now AMD has a more efficient arch and Intel is also entering with Xe. So laptop market will be difficult to stay in for Nvidia. Both Intel and AMD will have high end gaming laptops with using their own GPU and CPUs (Intel doesn't need Nvidia anymore to sell preimum laptops). And Nvidia can't offer a premium solution without a CPU.

Datacenter is the same thing. 

Why do you think Nvidia is desperate to buy ARM? (which won't save them even if it goes through)

Also Nvidia sold quite a bit of Power9 systems with Nvidia. But IBM is suing Global Fundries since they stopped development on future nodes which messed up IBM's Power road map (and because they financed node research). So even there Nvidia is going to take a hit.

26,UK," If I were in this position I'd be asking myself how much I cared about the 40K in comparison to when I needed the money again. 

For example you should look into a Roth IRA for this. But then if you're wanting to pull the money sooner rather than later for a house deposit that may not be ideal. Also if you want to pull it in a shorter time period you're at the mercy of the market when you buy a house. 

If the market shits itself the exact same time you want to buy you'd have to just suck it up. Unlike a long term pension style saving where you'd just average down and ride it out. 

As for mentioning how much you care about the money, are you going to invest more? If so how much? On one end if you're investing 40K a year and this is just the start you could just throw it in. On the other if you're investing nothing else you might want to average in like others have said. 

I do get the feeling your main goal for this money is a house deposit though. So you might be better off researching help to buy style options if there's any available to you. For example, in the UK I have a help to buy savings account that's next to zero risk (no stocks) and gives 20% extra at the time of purchasing.

Another option (hopefully the sub doesn't hate on me for this as I'm just trying to help) is Stablecoin by the way. Blockfi offer good interest rates and you're locked to the dollar so no dips as it's just interest.

The way I look at ETFs is unless you're investing at least half a million upfront then the returns they provide are basically a pension. Save a good chunk each month for your entire working life and let it compound away so you have that half a million for when you retire in your Roth IRA.",paulc19802,35,/r/stocks/comments/p4kgug/growing_my_savings/h8ziw1t/,0.049,0.804,0.147,0.9872
27,IMO," You've done well so far. Per user /tarheeltalent I would take somewhere in the middle. $20K should be fine for an emergency fund IMO, I'd put the other ~$25K in a broad index fund with low expense ratios. Something like VTI or VOO--you're on the right track.

Compounding is the 8th wonder of the world. The difference even from say 20 to 25 to 30 is great. Take advantage of it and don't look back!",68_Bullitt,10,/r/stocks/comments/p4kgug/growing_my_savings/h8ze9aq/,0.056,0.79,0.153,0.7959
28,STAG," Look into r/dividends - they're good with earning consistent money through dividends and growth. 

Figure out how much you need for 6 months in case something happens. Keep that in your account. 

I've picked up ONEQ instead of QQQ because of the comparable returns, but it's a cheaper stock that I can pick up more of. I have around 11k invested, so it's short of your 40k. 

SCHD is good, but VYM is another comparable stock if you want to spread risk. I'd also look into SCHY for some international exposure (they recently opened up to the public, so it's an early price point). 

If you're just looking for some returns, someone on Reddit suggested a ""quadfecta"" approach - essentially QYLD/JEPI/NUSI/DIVO in equal proportions to cover a good portion of the market with around 8 percent annual returns through dividends. I use this, but I wouldn't go more than like 20 percent of your portfolio into this strategy. I'll find and link the post after this. 

I'd look at DGRO as well. Their dividends are low, but they have good growth so far. If you're interested in individual stocks, I'd say check out STAG - about 4 percent dividends and their price has been steadily growing.",ColdDampForest,4,/r/stocks/comments/p4kgug/growing_my_savings/h8zk72g/,0.024,0.828,0.148,0.9771

30,AMT," Like other said, don't dump it all in at once. It sounds like you want to minimize your risk, but get a decent return on your money.

Always take a look at the composition of the index funds, make sure you aren't investing in the same companies (or if you are, it's a company you want to increase your position in), you want to spread your risk out as much as possible.

SPY & VOO are the same thing really... For your investing amount and needs... **VOO** would be the better choice with it's lower expense.

**SCHD** is a great dividend ETF (I have some), but careful as it does track the market pretty closely. Still, it offers some of the highest dividend amounts and good growth for it's class. Many call it the ""gold standard"".

I've recently shifted some of my ETFs from growth to more value... Besides **SCHD**, I also have some **VTV**, and a little **VV** (which is a blend).

Have you considered investing directly in some companies with a low beta? So even if the market takes a dive, your investment won't sink with it. For example... **VZ** Verizon stays pretty much within a small price range (even when COVID hit), but pays a good quarterly dividend like clockwork.

Let the dividend reinvest and enjoy the fact you are earning \~4.5% with minimal risk instead of the pennies at the bank. WMT, COST, TGT, KR, XEL, CCI, AMT are some others you might want to look at.

You can look at some of the REIT ETFs as they have large portions of AMT and CCI if that's the want you want to go. Likewise worth taking a look at the Consumer Staples ETF (which include WMT, COST, TGT, and KR).

People (usually) don't need money when times are good... It's when things times are bad that everyone starts eating into their savings. So if the market dives when you need your money the most... That's why I recommend the low-beta / dividend route for at least a portion.",TheMadBeaker,1,/r/stocks/comments/p4kgug/growing_my_savings/h91j1jp/,0.045,0.779,0.176,0.9928
36,XEL," Like other said, don't dump it all in at once. It sounds like you want to minimize your risk, but get a decent return on your money.

Always take a look at the composition of the index funds, make sure you aren't investing in the same companies (or if you are, it's a company you want to increase your position in), you want to spread your risk out as much as possible.

SPY & VOO are the same thing really... For your investing amount and needs... **VOO** would be the better choice with it's lower expense.

**SCHD** is a great dividend ETF (I have some), but careful as it does track the market pretty closely. Still, it offers some of the highest dividend amounts and good growth for it's class. Many call it the ""gold standard"".

I've recently shifted some of my ETFs from growth to more value... Besides **SCHD**, I also have some **VTV**, and a little **VV** (which is a blend).

First of all, that wasn't advice at all, go back and read what I said, I am sharing my experience and the experience of many friends of mine. 

I am not claiming it is only me who knew that google and nvidia will be doing great ""going back in time"" as you said, go through reddit and you will see a lot of people who bought nvidia and google lately without ""going back"". 

I don't think this is gambling, and btw I never gambled and I don't like it at all.

Part of my job is doing research on AI algorithms, that's why it was an easy educated guess to know that nvidia and google will be doing great.

40,AMD," Typically a very big basket

That's the point, because the basket is very big it allocates less and less percentage in order to have a diverse portfolio of stocks.

I am pretty sure, many people were expecting a significant rise in AMD and NVIDIA recently, right? Did these funds increase the percentage of these stocks in their allocations? If they did, how much was the increase? 

On the other hand, by doing your own research, and definitely taking your own risk, you can significantly increase your allocation for such stocks and then improve your profitability.",OutlandishnessDue500,5,/r/stocks/comments/p4kgug/growing_my_savings/h902gcl/,0.019,0.743,0.238,0.9663
41,CAN," I think we forget that Amazon and other US tech giants like Google are 'basically' their own 'ETF's. They operate in tens / hundreds of different sectors - Payment, autonomous driving, retail, space travel, entertainment, video streamling etc etc etc. It's just a matter of 'do I want to rely on the management of 1 business owner to influence my financial results' or 'do i want to leave my money in the hands of america's greatest businesses to work together.

And then think about a timeline.... Are you investing for 5-10 years? 20? 30? 50?

Will Amazon still be a leader in 20, 30, 50 years? Who knows. Nokia was the king until Apple wiped them off the map... will someone leave Amazon in the dust in 20 years? We can never know, but we CAN know that the US will continue to grow in 20 ,30, 50 years.

So i'd personally not put the 2 in the same basket. I'd invest heavily in the S&P to guarantee results until you die, and hold Amazon as a part of your portfolio, but not the pillar of your portfolio.

47,AMZN," SP500 makes more sense. You get AMZN exposure regardless but in a simple numbers game Amazon has to grow by how many billions to achieve 10-15% YoY growth for the next 10 years while the SP500 has a much smaller threshold in market cap to hit the same numbers. Dividend should also not be ignored in this scenario. 

E.G. AMZN market cap ~1.67T to achieve 10% growth it needs 167 Billion of additional value added. That’s just to achieve a 10% growth 1 time. The threshold increases every year. 

Meanwhile SPY has a ~402 Billion Market Cap and would only need 40.2 Billion of value increased in its first year to achieve 10%. While it’s required growth per year is also increasing its threshold is much smaller. That along with a dividend and near to Zero effort of maintenance I don’t see a reason to pick Amazon in the scenario. 

If the stock against it was a mid cap or small cap then it would be different and other conversions would need to take place, but SP500 ez pick here in comparison.",Kenan3345,3,/r/stocks/comments/p4ilu0/amazon_or_sp_500_over_the_next_ten_years_and_why/h8z6gzr/,0.0,0.834,0.166,0.9838
48,AMD," Easy, s&p 500, the reason why is you're assuming 10 years without being able to touch it. With one you have a guaranteed return, with the other, well historically looking at any one stock over the past hundred years. You could outperform but you're just as likely to lose against the index. There is so much that can happen over 10 years, even more over 20. There was a time when eBay looked like it was going to dominate internet commerce, intel was going to drive AMD out of business and blackberry was going to dominate the cell phone market. 

Amazon has two major risks over the next 10 years the first one is PE compression if growth slows, the second is a revolt against big tech which is not hard to envision. Those are also just the risks that I see. Some of the most sinister you don't really see until they happen. Tech in general also led the last 10 years. It's really unlikely the same sector will lead for 20 if you look at all the data going back to the year 1900",racebum,4,/r/stocks/comments/p4ilu0/amazon_or_sp_500_over_the_next_ten_years_and_why/h8zlga2/,0.09,0.842,0.068,-0.7576

That being said. I don't care about Bezos hate.  People don't like Musk they still buy Teslas, and the same people who complain about Bezos still have prime and shop on Amazon. Or at whole foods, or any of the other companies owned by Amazon. 

I also don't care about splits. It's just mental. Anyone who says they won't buy 1 share at 3,300 but they will buy 10 shares at 330 doesn't know what they're doing.

97,MU," Mu right now has an estimated price to forward earnings of about 6.26.  This sounds low, but it doesnt happen by accident.  Whenever forward earnings are priced at a low multiple, it's because the expectation is that the company's earnings will stagnate or fall.  This could be due to reduced demand, increasing competition or shrinking margins.  MU is also seeing some increased capital expenditure that may not 

There is a lot of selling because people are considering if 2022 is peak earnings for MU.  

The bull case for them is that they're able to maintain margins and demand, and are able to keep some earnings growth.  Then their Cap ex pays off down the line and further increases their market share by providing a superior product line.

The bear case (and the one currently prevailing) is that earnings will stagnate or shrink on reduced demand or an over supplied market over the next 5 years, while inflation pushes expenses higher.

135,HNST," I analyze companies for investing and also like their products but I personally wouldn’t invest in them. Mainly because they’ve been around for a decade and still haven’t figured out how to turn a profit despite having a decent product. Add to that the fact that they have a lot of debt, negative equity, and still somehow have a market cap of almost $1B. I would consider this to be a high risk play so maybe not the best for someone new to the market.

Like someone mentioned, your best bet is to probably put your money (that you won’t need for a while) in an ETF like VOO. Or put most of it in an ETF and a small % in HNST if you really believe in their future ability to become profitable and pay down their debts.

140,LOVE," It’s 70%+ in Los Angeles and it’s all about labor and chicken costs. They seem to struggle with expansion and have very concentrated risks. Idk a lot about it tbh but it’s interesting so I read up. On the east coast it’s more Peruvian chicken all around with small operators dominating. Here’s some cool points from a recent report. 

https://investor.elpolloloco.com/node/10536/html

“We currently source poultry from six suppliers, with two accounting for approximately 62% of our purchases for fiscal 2020. We have fixed prices for 100% of our poultry supply through the end of 2021.”


“Our revenue per restaurant is typically lower in the first and fourth quarters due to reduced January and December transactions and higher in the second and third quarters. As a result of seasonality, our quarterly and annual results of operations and key performance indicators such as company restaurant revenue and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate.”


“Our company-operated and franchised restaurants in the greater Los Angeles area generated, in the aggregate, approximately 71.3% of our revenue in fiscal 2020 and approximately 70.5% in fiscal 2019. Adverse changes in demographic, unemployment, economic, or regulatory conditions in the greater Los Angeles area or in the State of California, including, enforcement policies for and changes in immigration law, have had and may continue to have material adverse effects on our business.”


“Federally-mandated, state-mandated, or locally-mandated minimum wages have recently increased in several jurisdictions, including the State of California and Los Angeles County, and may be further raised in the future. We may be unable to sufficiently increase our menu prices in order to pass future increased labor costs on to our customers, in which case our margins would be negatively affected. Also, reduced margins of franchisees could make it more difficult to sell franchises. In addition, increases in menu prices by us and our franchisees to cover increased labor costs could have the effect of lowering sales, which would thereby reduce our margins and the royalties that we receive from franchisees.”

“To balance our portfolio, we entered into an interest rate swap during the year ended December 25, 2019 with a notional amount of $40.0 million, related to the outstanding borrowings under our 2018 Revolver [$150 million]. The interest rate swap was designated as a cash flow hedge and effectively converted a portion of our outstanding borrowings to a fixed rate of 1.31%, plus applicable margin, which is currently 1.5%. The interest rate swap matures in June 2023.”


“In fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, Company-operated and franchised restaurants in the greater Los Angeles area generated, in the aggregate, approximately 71.3%, 70.5%, and 69.2%, respectively, of total revenue. One franchisee accounted for 11.5% of total accounts receivable as of December 30, 2020, and one franchisee accounted for 10% of total accounts receivable as of December 25, 2019.

185,TSLA," Two months is just a number it could be a month or three- 

There is no possible way that Tesla keeps growing revenue so high consistently, there’s simply not that many people that can justify buying a car that expensive. and it’s been showing recently that these overvalued (over 70 p/e for example) companies fall even if they meet expectations. All TSLA needs is an on par or below expectations earning report and it will fall massively because it’s not growing how the investors are paying for.",Andrew3742,0,/r/stocks/comments/p4wk8j/arkw_vs_tesla_for_max_gains/h920esx/,0.025,0.921,0.054,0.128
186,FSD," ARKW and Tesla (and all growth companies) both stand to grow tremendously assuming continued low interest rates (which seems likely given the growing perception that we need climate change innovation and low interest rates is how the US gov prefers to incentivize innovation).

ARKW will always be anchored by the worst performing companies in its portfolio, which means lower potential returns. But the diversification means lower potential losses as well.

Tesla is truly the Wild West. If you believe they’ll crack FSD in the next few years, or that they’ll dominate a new energy market that will be appearing over the next 10 years, then you’re looking at massive returns that ARKW probably won’t be able to compete with (regardless of how well it performs).

So if you’re looking for highest potential return, go Tesla. If you want less risk, or don’t believe in Tesla’s ability to execute on FSD or Energy, go ARKW (though their exposure to Tesla means maybe just avoid them if you’re really anti-Tesla). If you believe the Fed issuing easy money is going to dry up in the next year or so, probably don’t invest in either.",tomaskruz28,1,/r/stocks/comments/p4wk8j/arkw_vs_tesla_for_max_gains/h922aie/,0.093,0.764,0.143,0.8758
187,ATH," In some sense, it already did. See $WKHS, $NKLA, $RIDE, $QS, $ARVL, et al. All EV related stocks -70 to -83% from ATH. Note that one thing all these stocks, and other EV-related stocks that crashed majorly, have in common, is that they don't have deliverables. They were all truly all hype and hopium, with claims of their first products being delivered like 2 years later? 

Then notice how the companies with actual products being delivered to customers today, $NIO, $TSLA, and arguably even traditional auto OEMs like $F, $GM, and others did not suffer from the same fate with the price action YTD. $TSLA dropped ~36% from ATHs, now back up 27% from that point (current price $720 implies a net drop from ATH of 18%), so on and so forth. 

Sure, one can argue about the growth trajectories of $TSLA and start-up EV companies, but at least Tesla has proven that they have the capabilities to scale rapidly with the model 3 ramp and the delivery numbers so far this year. I'm not going to argue that their 50% growth rate for deliveries is sustainable for the next 9-10 years, the valuation stuff is up for debate. The point I'm trying to make is that the EV hype seems to have died down majorly, and the outlook of EV stocks are (arguably) reflected in their current price.",wowAmaze,2,/r/stocks/comments/p4wk8j/arkw_vs_tesla_for_max_gains/h923hin/,0.053,0.888,0.06,-0.0991
