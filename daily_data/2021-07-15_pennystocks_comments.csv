7,ID," How about an OTC stock that has $300M+ in revenues, \~$80M of adjusted Trailing Twelve Month EBITDA, a real management team with Fortune 500 senior executive experience, just refinanced debt in Q1 2021 (and has 5 years on the debt before maturity) that grew EBITDA 78% last quarter.  It could go up 3-5x.  Crazy part is this is a deep value stock where the earnings more than justify the increase in the valuation... so, it's not on the come, but here today!

Catalysts?  They've applied to go on the NASDAQ and meet minimum requirements - meaning mutual funds can buy the stock now (see page 32 of 10K dated 2/25/2021).  Management about to have their first earnings call in August 2021 after not having one since March 2020.  I think analysts are going to cover the stock.  When they report Q2 2021, they'll cycle through the horrible Q2 2020 numbers due to pandemic... meaning the trailing twelve month EBITDA will go up 33% (if my projections of Q2 2021 that is at minimum on par with Q1 2021 is true... changing my adjusted TTM EBITDA to actual TTM EBITDA) and that'll get picked up by the quant trading machines.  And management could start going on the road to market the stock after focusing on debt refinancing over the course of the last year or two after their first earnings call in August 2021.  

***CPI Card Group.  Ticker: PMTS.***  \~$200M market cap.  $300M+ revenues.  Adjusted EBITDA of \~$80M (adjusted meaning stripping out impact of Q2 2020 when everyone had a crap quarter - Q3 20 $17M, Q4 20 $17.5M, Q1 21 $22M and if you assume trend is new normal, then Q2 21 is $20M or so).  Last quarter, revenues up 20%, EBITDA up 78%, Op Inc up 137%, adj net income up 337% (adjusted for one-time refinancing costs of debt).  Refinanced their debt 3/2021 and have 5 years on their net $300M of debt.  While debt looks like a lot, remember Debt/EBITDA is only 3.75x - which will continue to down as EBITDA continues growing.  

So, here's the deal.  They make plastic credit cards.  In 2015/2016, the industry moved to EMV (Europay, Mastercard, and Visa) chips - the little chips you see on the right side of all your credit cards.  Manufacturers ramped up capacity.  Industry pulled forward demand and bought a ton of cards.  EMV chips lasted longer than magnetic stripes and expiration of cards went from 3 years to 5 years - reducing demand for cards significantly.  Industry was destroyed due to reduction of demand while supply went up.  #1 and #2 players Thales/Gemalto and Idemia both converted a bunch of their capacity to make drivers licenses and other forms of ID and took capacity out of the credit card industry.  CPI was weakened because they had debt from a dividend recap.  In 2017, CPI interest expense was higher than their EBITDA.  Company is hurtling towards bankruptcy.  

In 2017, one of their board members who had retired as CFO of Western Union (and before that First Data - so CFO of two Fortune 500 companies and a real exec... not the crap execs you usually see in OTC companies) comes out of retirement and jumps in as CEO.  So what happens?  CPI is hurtling towards bankruptcy and probably would have gone under except for the pandemic.  Why?  

Pricing on EMV chip cards had gone to crap and there was little profitability.  Prior CEO had tried to tell people that contactless cards was going to save the company's hide, but reality was that NO ONE wanted to pay for contactless cards or the terminals.  Most of the merchants had credit card readers / terminals that could read contactless, but it cost $150-200 in software to turn on the functionality.  Only maybe 30-40% of the terminals in late 2019 had the software installed.  

What changed?  The pandemic!  Now getting out of the store quickly and making consumers comfortable with going into stores is important.  Not only does going contactless mean that you don't have to stick the card in that little slot and have to stand next to the cashier, but contactless transactions also go faster.  That's why retailers now are paying for the terminals.

For the card issuers, contactless and the pandemic is a chance to get people to shift from cash to credit / debit cards.  Read the Visa and Mastercard Q2 transcripts and earnings releases.  They say that $18T of transactions can go to credit cards because of contactless.  And in the US, there's a coin shortage that forces everyone to use credit cards.  2% of $18T of what were once cash transactions will pay for a ton of contactless cards!  Contactless is king and is here to stay whether or not the pandemic remains.  Oh and the pandemic is still here.  

When issuers buy contactless cards, the average selling prices and gross profit doubles.  The company's business model has a very fixed cost.  If you look at the sales, general & administrative expenses, they were actually DOWN in Q1 2021 even though gross profit went up.  That's how you end up with a 78% increase in EBITDA while revenues only increase by 20%.  Does that mean the end of it?  Nope.  Here's the really fun part.

CPI's business has a mix of large issuers (JPMorgan Chase, BofA, USBancorp, etc - may not be actual customers, but type of customers) and small issuers (fintechs, credit unions, small issuers, etc).  If you read the Q4 2020 earnings letter, you'll see a large percentage (I think 70%) of large issuers have moved to contactless.  Small issuers as of Q4 2020 had only moved maybe 10% over to contactless.  It took small issuers 3-4 years to move to EMV from magnetic stripe and if this trend repeats, then the earnings for the company will go up for 3-4 years at a rapid clip as small issuers adopt contactless.  The increase in the earnings haven't stopped yet and have a long tail!  If you read the Q4 2020 letter, you'll see that small issuers made up 66% of the company's revenues - meaning that the business is weighted towards the part of the business that is going to grow as small issuers adopt contactless.  

So, what's the valuation for all I'm writing about - the answer is CHEAP.  Market cap is $200M.  Net debt is about $300M (actually less, let's keep the math easy).  $500M enterprise value.  Adjusted EBITDA of \~$80M.  EV/Adj EBITDA is about 6.25x.  This again is on a company whose EBITDA grew 78% last quarter.  Prior two quarters also had explosive EBITDA growth of north of 50%.  Basically EBITDA has exploded since the pandemic hit and adoption of contactless increased rapidly.  

Assuming a not outrageous 10x EV/EBITDA, then you get an enterprise value of $800M.  Back out the debt of $300M, then the market cap is $500M.  that's about a 3x return on current earnings power.  This isn't a pie in the sky if XYZ happens, but using CURRENT economic earnings.  

Where the valuation gets more interesting is if the earnings continue growing due to increased  adoption of contactless that's HERE TO STAY.  If EBITDA goes to $100M and EV/EBITDA goes to 15x, then one can get to a $1.5B enterprise value.  Again, back out $200M of debt and market cap is now $1.2B.  With 11.6M shares outstanding, it's possible to get to $100 stock price.  

Don't take my word for it.  It isn't on the come.  Go read the company's Q3 2020 - Q1 2021 earnings letters.  Go read the company's 10Q and 10K.  On page 32 of the 10K dated 2/25/2021, you'll see this beauty "" We are evaluating our ability to return to listing on Nasdaq and intend to ***apply for listing on The Nasdaq Global Market as we are able and eligible to do so***.""  They have already applied to go on the NASDAQ.  Just a matter of time.  

To recap:

1. Real business... manufacturing business that makes real revenues and real profits
2. Former CFO of two fortune 500 companies that came out of retirement to turn around the business
3. Fast growing business with long tail from continued adoption of contactless credit cards from their majority small issuer (66% of revenues per Q4 2020 earnings letter) customers.
4. Exposure to the fast growing fintech market (customers include oxygen and other fintechs)
5. Fixed cost business model with explosive earnings growth as revenues continue growing.
6. Cheap valuation due to being on the OTC and being currently ignored by all the fund screens and quantitative traders
7. Cheap valuation (again just adjusting out Q2 2020 pandemic quarter that hurt the business temporarily) of ***6.25x EV/EBITDA*** while revenues and EBITDA exploding.
8. Catalysts of NASDAQ listing, first earnings call since March 2020, potential analyst coverage, mutual buying due to re-listing, quantitative trader buying from stock showing up on screens with re-listing and continued adoption of contactless

If you are intrested in NEXCF, you can find online their financials. MVIS is not a pennystock anymore, I bought at 60 cents and still holding at 14 Dollars today. 

Q1 this year of NEXCF:

47,ATOS," You really need to understand their phase in their development because the examples you are looking at haven't gotten to the point where they can be profitable. ABML for example is an exploration phase company with a recycling plant planned. Until the plant is complete they are going to be expense only but the value is in their ability to get the plant done and meet the future demands. So pure speculation. Much the same with all of the other. The value is in the belief that they are going to get to their goals. I have a big position in RQHTF for the same reason. If I look at their posted financials I wouldn't buy it. However I can see their projections and believe in their product. They will/should post profitability in the near term here and then their financials will look much better. Of course, once that happens, they won't be trading where they are now. Same with ABML once they are in production recycling batteries. Same with ATOS if/when they get thier drug approved. No clue on SPRT, never looked at them. Ideally, you want to find companies that are far enough in their development that they can get to the prize before they transition to profitability as that is where you will find big wins. In my opinion anyway. It is why you can get massive gains. Companies that are profitable don't move 500% in a year.

Looking at your criteria of what you are looking for. Do some DD on RQHTF. It currently meets your wants. Revenue is growing and they have said they would be profitable this month with 11M in sales by end of year. Their net on their product is way above the industry standard and is getting better every month (Better than 50% net on sales). No real debt to speak of at this point. I would take some time to understand their business model as a subscription service for chronic conditions fully funded by Medicare and Medicaid. They have 250k potential subscribers in queue to be added to the system with about 10000 on the system now. They are adding them on quickly and have said they expect to have 27000 on the system within 12 months. Average net on each client is $50 so if they get to that number they will have at least 1.35M in monthly income. Best part is that number just keeps growing as they add more people and more conditions to the service. It is cheap now and with the growth it won't be long. The company expects to be take over within the next couple years but if not they could be making over 100m a year by then.

I don't really get how you can say they aren't making much money either. They made over 2mil in Q1 when in the previous quarters they were making just over 500k. That is a massive improvement from a revenue standpoint and in my opinion IS much money compared to the previous quarters/years.

They also have more clinics rolling out/leases signed/partnerships closing (not BUILT out yet) than ever before and they were still making money before they acquired them.

I agree that speculation is always warranted for penny stocks but I believe this particular one has many encouraging signs.

I've noticed throughout the year that while many things have run, strictly sticking to the date often parroted for that stuff and not taking the current situation into account tends to lead to you losing out on money.

ZOM had the Trueforma catalyst and was set to peak at its launch at the end of the month and ran up several times. But then they released it early which cut the hype train early. If you actually held to the original launch date you got shredded. Then look at TRCH. Many said the play was to buy and sell on the Ex Div date. But it started running up hard just a bit before that date and it was stated by a CEO that shares needed 2 days to settle. Thus it was more pragrmatic to lock in profit 2-3 days in advance of the Ex Div date rather than actually let all your sures sit for it and the merger and wouldn't you know it, after that Ex Div date, it tanked.
