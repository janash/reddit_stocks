0,GME," It's great to see how these scrapers actually resolve! Quick buying and selling isn't my wheelhouse, but it might be interesting to play with a little. Guess we'll see how this whole sentiment analysis holds up long term, if the GME and associates craze dies down.

One interesting thing to look at categories you've decided are viable in more detail would be a graphic display of the data (days to max, % to max, etc.) to get a better idea of the distribution and what that average means. 

Would also be interesting to know what numerical criteria you're using for step 1 - ""hasn't popped yet"". And to have a look at them to see the minimum number of different random stocks from this pool that need doing each day to acceptably minimise the chance of a loss in the back data.

Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook are on the knife's edge right now (as in, the last and next couple of years). People are worried about their personal data, there is tons of scandals with how they use it to influence people, and these giants being too big and too powerful are something that (at least publically), both left and right seem to agree. I think everyone knows that they will not be allowed to operate as they do now forever, so I'd guess 'the government would try to avoid being dependent on them as well. 

(For the record, I'm not naive, I am pretty sure that the government will not ""save the people"" from this. They probably have most politicians in their pocket on both ends of the spectrum, to some degree, and politicians love what tech can do for them, so I doubt they will put a *real* stop to it.

77,CRSP," Crisper refers to a technique that can be used by anyone. Crisper is actually a naturally occurring phenomenon that occurs in bacteria. This phenomenon was described by one academic group from Berkeley and shortly following this discovery another independent group from Harvard applied it to a mammalian system. Originally, the crisper technology was used as a molecular biology technique at a basic science level to create unique cell lines, etc. What CRSP is trying to do is apply this technology for clinical applications.

78,EDIT," Crisper refers to a technique that can be used by anyone. Crisper is actually a naturally occurring phenomenon that occurs in bacteria. This phenomenon was described by one academic group from Berkeley and shortly following this discovery another independent group from Harvard applied it to a mammalian system. Originally, the crisper technology was used as a molecular biology technique at a basic science level to create unique cell lines, etc. What CRSP is trying to do is apply this technology for clinical applications.

79,CRSP," I'd also like to add that for a lot of biotech, they spin out of technology developed by people at academic institutes. For example, professors and researchers will create the technology and be named in the patent, but because they work for a university, the university owns the patent. This is all stipulated when you're hired/enrolled for school. 

Companies can be started by the creators, but they'll license the technology from the university. I believe this is the case of CRSP.

But it's not just startups that do this. Large companies like Bayer, Pfizer, etc will also license technology or therapeutics from universities. They just don't have the manpower or resources to study everything they want to, so it's good business to find academics who have and license it.

Sure, but if that takes so long to develop that it doesn’t occur in your lifetime or occurs when you’re really old, why invest in it? I’d invest in a broad genomics ETF like ARKG to capitalize on what I think are going to be the real money makers in the field in the next couple decade: genetic sequencing and bioinformatics, while still having a stake in CRISPR (there’s been a HUGE rise in prevalence of single-cell genetic sequencing and advanced bioinformatics amongst biomedical scientists (am earning my PhD in Bioengineering, see it every day)). While CRISPR has had a huge impact and will continue to have an enormous impact, I think media hype and oversimplification is often confused for change-the-entire-world-in-a-decade type potential. That being said, if people are excited about something, price will go up in the short term whether the company changes the world or not, so maybe do invest. But there’s a lot of growth yet to occur in the industry - bugs in the BASIC science of CRISPR are still being worked out, let alone meaningful widespread clinical translation (although there has been some clinical translation). So there are still many decades for companies to rise and fall, new companies to become the “big players.” If you are going to invest in a single company now that’s purely CRISPR based, I do think CRSP is the move.

83,IMO," Advantage? I believe they don't have one.

When it comes to scienceing, especially with CRISPR--Cas9, is that it's really, really hard. In this specific case pretty much hit and. So this publicly traded company just has to keep sciencing like crazy to science a science. In the meantime the other scientists at several other non-public (the best ones, IMO are not public) and public companies are sciencing. So while no doubt these scientists are scienceing their science, there's also the next guy scienceing their science and, in this case in particular, they're all throwing darts in the dark hoping to hit bullseye, patents or no.

So yeah, go ahead and invest, but fundamentally all biotech companies are risky af.

104,AI," So yes and no, and that’s the hardest part. So in some diseases you theoretically could do this, and would need even less individuals if you identified the specific cancer gene, as you can specifically test said gene further to determine its use in the disease or process. With cancer though this becomes very complicated because many different genes may be activating/inhibiting and just overall interacting with one another to create the outcome we see. At some point I strongly believe self-learning AI will be able to recognize the patterns and ways cells interact more effectively than humans do now. This being a reality would be a game changer and allow us to determine significantly more about diseases, and the way cells even work and dare I say it maybe one day cure cancer.

118,DD," A few thoughts:

* The usefulness can vary based on where they are scraping and how they compute sentiment (use of and configuration of NLP, for example).  Few share their ""secret sauce"" so difficult to determine effectiveness of their methodology.
* The analysis provided caters to the growing generation of young retail investors who tend to focus on posts which garner a higher engagement rate (likes, comments, upvotes, retweets, etc) instead of relevance of content.
* Macro trends tend to be more useful yet I haven't found anyone offering longer term analysis.
* Related to above, I haven't found anyone offering correlation analysis - sentiment compared to volume, price, short interest, or as a function of company news (earnings reports, hiring/firing announcements, insider transactions, etc).  I feel this would be far more useful than stand-alone sentiment analysis.

176,CPA," This is actually a great buying opportunity. I'm a CPA and there was no malicious wrong doing here. Basically what's going on which happens frequently in accounting field is interpretation on a highly complex Lease Accounting standard (ASC 842). The standard relates to how you record certain equipment and property leases. A lot of judgement is required on how certain leases are treated. Certain treatments require you to put more liability or expense on your books over a period of time. It just looks like the auditors at the last minute decided that they wanted the company to slightly switch up the treatment when then caused the need for restatement.

Why is this not as bad as people think? Because they are not restating their revenue and sales numbers. If they had to restate on how they are recording sales, then that would be a huge issue. Luckily here is just related to their treatment of some of their expenses and liabilities so it shouldn't affect their continued outlook on revenue targets in the future.

193,PM," **Stock Market Weather Forecast**

Today is Fed Announcement Day, the day we all gather round and listen to old Mr. Powell tell us about how interest rates aren't raising and the Fed will stay the course on its current policy, and all the little boys and girls in Wall Street make believe that he might have said something else.

Expect big swings up and down throughout the day, with the first swing taking us upward at market open, but the greatest swing coming at 2:00 PM.

I'm predicting today will be a red day with a NASDAQ high of 13,616 and low of 13,395.

The next three days will be rocky, but when it's over, we'll know for sure if the correction is over or just beginning. If we end the week above 13,600, we're golden.

[*View past predictions here.*](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/1Jw6B)

*EDIT: This was a really bad prediction. I'll stick by it for tracking my success rate, but in case anyone wants it, our support line seems to be firmly at 13,272. Resistance is 13,403. Both of these could be broken after 2:00 PM, but should hold until then.*",wsb_shitposting,20,/r/stocks/comments/m6wjs8/rstocks_daily_discussion_wednesday_mar_17_2021/gr8f2o2/,0.058,0.85,0.093,0.8106

256,DD," Decent day, everything green except for my two penny stock where my total loss/gains are .10 loss for HIPH and a 7k gain for DFLYF.  Up 3.32%.  I am a noob and I started on January 24th by Feb 20 I was losing my ass to a tune of 6.5K.  Got super lucky on DFLYF to get back to even. I have been pretty lucky and have had time to digest some nuances of the market I did not realize.

1. if a stock goes up like a rocket....it usually falls down like a rock.  With DFLYF I was up to 12k at one point.  Got greedy thinking I was going to the moon still exited with 6k
2. learned what a limit order was, which helps me earn a few dimes
3. learned what a stop loss was, saved me a few times
4. learned that profit is profit no matter if it is 6 dollars or 6k
5. Wash sales suck
6. Having money available to buy shit on the fly is a good idea.  10-15 times so far I have ended the day green because of a quick 2k buy and a quick turnaround sell for 2150.  Yeah, I have missed some larger gains but I still was green at the end of the day.
7. Meme stocks can earn you a pissload in a second, and break you in a second.  Gamestop has made me a pretty penny and lost me a pretty penny.  That shit is like heroin....try it once and GTFO.
8. Diamond Hands are complete bullshit on a lot of stocks.  Thank you rocket mortgage. (i will be crying Friday when it hits 100)
9. DD is a pain the ass and time-consuming as Fuck.  It takes a skilled human to parse through all the info, ADHD sucks for that.
10. I am learning about margin trading and I think I might avoid that for a while.

288,NIO," If anything, this has finally convinced me to get out of Plug and ICLN altogether. The last few months we've seen a green energy hype much like the last time and I'm convinced the bubble is bursting.

We expected it to be different this time because of the Biden/Trump election, Covid, and the over-hyped EV industry. We thought Biden would heavily focus on green energy after rejoining the Paris accord, but like most campaign promises that quickly fell through and nothing substantial happened after that. He's just pushing old policies while barely keeping the country together (figuratively in terms of the economy/Covid/Syria and literally in terms of infrastructure).

The timing would be ideal because of Covid. We started working from home and stopped international travel and it had a positive impact on the environment. Oil and gas industries tanked. This would be the ideal moment to start with a clean slate and go all in on renewable energy. Except we didn't, and we're barely in control of the Covid situation. It'll take a good few years to fully recover from the pandemic before we can even start to think about new sources of energy again.

Also, the stock market was obsessed with EV, Tesla and NIO mostly, which are incredibly overvalued. Even Musk admitted that they barely make a profit, can't reach deadlines, and that the battery technology just isn't there yet. It'll take years before they are a serious player in the market (serious, as in, actually selling cars and not just branding and over-valuation), and in the meantime other car manufactures are catching up (with the help of Apple, Gates, etc., possibly even a partnership with Tesla in the future so that Musk can focus on tech rather than manufacturing).

Don't get me wrong, we are definitely moving towards other sources of energy, if not nuclear than most likely renewable. But we aren't there yet. The technology isn't ready, most companies are still in their infancy (compared to the current big players), and it'll take years of Covid recovery and political lobbying before we'll make a serious investment in green energy again. You can go long on the current companies, but whose to say these are still the big players 10, 15 years from now? Especially when companies like Plug are faltering and traditional Oil and Gas is pivoting towards renewable energy with much more capital and political backing behind them.",dr0nec0ma,1,/r/stocks/comments/m6k9e7/plug_power_down_ah_buying_opportunity_and_why/gr86ou9/,0.032,0.811,0.157,0.9953

As far as advice goes: buy stocks that you don't expect to sell for at least a year. After holding for over a year you only get hit with long-term capital gains tax, which is much cheaper than short term taxes. If you sell a stock after every bump, you might miss out on much larger gains in the future (and you get hit with higher taxes on your gains.)

For example, I sold my TSLA (after holding for years) at the top of the market a year ago at a 3x gain (\~$170 per share). Not bad, but if I had ridden out the dip for another 12 months I would have made at least an additional 4x on top of that.",mailseth,5,/r/stocks/comments/m6mcro/tips_for_helping_when_to_sell_a_stock/gr74ul7/,0.007,0.885,0.108,0.9026

303,DD," Risk tolerance and FOMO is difficult to manage sometimes. Helps to reason out and set yourself loss tolerance and gain goal and stick with it unless something significant in the world happens. Don't think of one big trade, but a series of many good trades. 10% gain is doing good so sell, 20% you're doing great so sell. Anything above that consider it luck and sell. If it goes higher after you sell don't regret, keep in mind what your goal was and that you achieved it and you're trying to make gains in the long run and not through luck. If you reinvest with 10% gain 3 times you're actually up 33% due to compounding interest. If you do it 8 times you've more than doubled your investment. Don't forget even with DD and fundamentals and even pop culture/trend pushing the stock along, one significant bad news and it'll drop. Just imagine what would happen to $TSLA if Elon died or became severely ill, or $COKE if news came out lead somehow got in millions of shipments. Happened to me with $EBIX.

306,GE," I work for a company that manufactures parts for RR, GE, and other airplane/aerospace companies. We’re bracing for a major uptick when restrictions are lifted. One of the things many people don’t realize about airplanes and their engines, is the amount of maintenance that goes into them. Every XX hours the engines need to be rebuilt, essentially. Add to that all of these planes that have been mothballed for COVID are going to need tune-ups etc before they can start flying again, and companies like RR are going to be busier than ever trying to get planes back in the sky to meet demand. They’re already starting to try and get ahead, but when the flood gates open it going to be difficult for the industry to keep up (they expect).

As far as it returning to its precovid levels, that would still mean it’ll go back to $8-$9 per share. But during this pandemic, as stated above, they have been just unloading debt left and right. So much so that they are expecting to be actually earning a profit by 2023, something they weren’t even doing precovid. Additionally they have a strong R&D division looking towards electric and nuclear powered engines. But to return to your question about why rising above their covid levels, I’m expecting a huge airline boom for the next two years minimum. And with RR’s biggest competitor just having 2 engine malfunctions (on separate planes, no one was hurt) where one burst into flames mid flight. They also make money off of the miles flown on the engines they sell, which is just an amazing revenue stream imo, others might do it but idk.

Also they are the GE of England.

308,GE," 1) I never insulted you, grow tf up (that barely counts)

2)RYCEY follows and tracks the movement of RR.L in London, while holders didn’t get the special dividend their share price still changed to reflect the fact that one was paid. 

3) RR.L split in October, RYCEY (which again, isn’t RR.L but rather an ADR stock that is managed by J.P. Morgan) as a result had to add shares that ended up diluting the total number lowering it to what we see today. 

4) all prices you see currently on the charts going back to precovid have all the dilution and everything allready accounted for, you can see it was above $8 in Jan and Feb of 2020. 

Finally your argument that it would have to trade at 4 times what it’s worth precovid assumes it would trade at a P/E ratio of 1. Since it’s mostly compared to GE let’s see what GE’s P/E is at... 314.5 so yeah I would say RYCEY’s current P/E ratio of 1.4 has enough room to grow to 5 or 6 to get to those price targets of $13-$18.",TheFondestComb,-7,/r/stocks/comments/m6k6tj/rolls_royce_future_outlook/gr76yk4/,0.03,0.888,0.082,0.7876

391,GME," Question about naked shorting, a possible stock recall and Cede:

I'll try to be as brief as possible. It seems like the hedge funds simply keep shorting GME over and over again to try to cover, thereby digging themselves into a deeper hole (using a credit card to pay off another credit card). This normally would end in disaster once your credit runs out. But – will their credit ever run out? Since it seems they can short the same stocks – wether naked or real – as many times as they want, can they just keep doing that indefinitely if they want?

Unless GME does a stock recall, wherein they're supposedly screwed, right? But I've been thinking: how do us retail investors know that we're holding 'real' shares? What if shares we bought are counterfeit? And on top of that there's Cede and Co, who actually own the stocks while we just 'license' them, so couldn't they just decide that the hedge funds have the real stocks while us suckers actually have the fake ones and screw us over that way?",Hotspur000,3,/r/stocks/comments/m6wefb/rstocks_daily_thread_on_meme_stocks_wednesday_mar/gr8rvn3/,0.083,0.802,0.114,0.4871

414,AAPL," Wow...fees? Still?  I use a few different platforms (I’m a sucker for bonuses for opening accounts)
Stash charges a monthly fee (I pay $1/month) but they offered me $30 when I opened my account and added $5... a week after adding the money, I didn’t see the extra $ so I sent them a message and they added $50 to my account, so I got $50 for $5 ...
Then I have Merrill Edge which I’ve had since 2014, but sometime between 2017 when I sold my AAPL and this February when I got back into trading, they eliminated their old $7 fee... so now I can trade all day... I still have some 1 penny federal fee per order (not per share) but that is very negligible...
Finally, I recently opened up a Schwab account....another bonus giver, they gave me $100 (apparently it can take a month, still waiting because I just opened it a week ago)... no fees, no minimum but the platform isn’t as user friendly as Merrill (at least not on my iPad) ...
If you want to open an account with either of the two bonus companies, here are links...
I guess the one you do (unless like me you do both) it matters how much you invest... in order to get the bonus in Schwab, you need to deposit $1,000 or more, whereas Stash only requires $5 investment.

439,AAPL," Covered calls cap your gains while still exposing you to the same downside risk. The premium is also dependent on how volatile the stock price is, if the stock is **too** stable, then the premium is also going to be really low. Using your AAPL example, let's say you buy 100 shares for $125 and sell a 3/26 130C for $0.94:

1. If the price of AAPL shoots up to $150 at expiration, you're forced to sell at $130, giving up an additional $20/share = $2000.

2. If the price of AAPL drops to $105, you keep the $94 premium, but you lose $20/share = $2000. The +$94 is going to seem like nothing next to the -$2000.

3. Realistically, you're looking at a 10-20% return/year selling options, which sounds pretty nice but you also have to actively manage it. Some ETFs can return that much or more, and all you have to do is buy and hold and check it once a month.

4. It doesn't really give you much protection if the market goes against you, just a band-aid at most. While there's stories of people who turned a losing position into profit by selling CC's, it also ties up a lot of capital in a losing position rather than cutting losses and deploying elsewhere for potentially bigger gains in a shorter amount of time.

CC's work best in a sideways market or one that's slowly going up at a predictable rate, but not so well when things are volatile or dropping.",Kalsin8,9,/r/stocks/comments/m6wd4h/need_help_understanding_selling_ccs_sounds_too/gr8abl5/,0.094,0.786,0.12,0.8799

Say my target sell price is $65, I then sell $64 covered calls and collect $100 premium. If they don't assign i keep my $100 and still collect any dividends. If they do assign, I was planning on selling at $65 anyways so it makes no difference to me.",Dotifo,4,/r/stocks/comments/m6wd4h/need_help_understanding_selling_ccs_sounds_too/gr83bgz/,0.06,0.897,0.043,-0.4376

442,AAPL," You also should research “Poor mans covered calls” if you are interested in this.  In short you buy a deep in the money call that has a far out expiration date. Then you can sell covered calls against them in the short term. Your long term call ( called a LEAP) acts as collateral for owning 100 shares. You can sell covered calls for a fraction of the price. In your example, you’d probably only have to throw down 5 grand for one AAPL LEAP instead of 12 grand and still collect the same premiums.

444,SBUX," Simply, it’s not too good to be true. Usually the amount you make is very very small. If you have a stock with high IV your returns can be better but you also run the risk of the stock tanking or exploding past your strike. 

My first attempt at a covered call was with SBUX many years ago. It was around $40 and I think I wrote a call at $45. The stock went up, I got exercised, and then watched in horror as it continued to climb to $180... thinking about all the gains I missed from collecting the “free money”.",Spectacle_Maker,1,/r/stocks/comments/m6wd4h/need_help_understanding_selling_ccs_sounds_too/gr88kmx/,0.129,0.806,0.064,-0.7907

446,CC," you've got the jist of it. there are only 2 things to keep in mind

1. if a share blows by your strike price, you miss out on that revenue (say you get that $130 aapl call in your example, but it ends up closing at $180). you still made money, but less than you would have otherwise

2. if you buy a share to sell CC's on and then it tanks in value, it puts you in kind of a bad spot. your premium doesn't cover the losses, then when the call expires and you do your next round, the desirable premiums could represent a loss if they strike.

now, of course, neither of those things are deal breakers. i'm totally on board with the notion that selling covered calls is AWESOME. my cc income vastly outpaces my dividends.

selling puts is pretty awesome too if you have margin enabled on your account (since you're required to have to have access to the money in case the strike hits, so it just reserves a portion of your ""available for trading"" balance, but obviously you wouldn't want to have actual cash sitting there doing nothing which is why you'd just have it reserve margin room you're not using anyways).

basically you get paid a premium when you sell just like a CC, but instead of doing stuff above the price point, you go the other direction. you say ""i'd totally by aapl if it dropped to $100/share"", then sell something like the $100 4/30 which currently has a 30 cent premium.

if aapl drops below $100 share in the next month and a half, someone can force you to buy the shares you would have bought anyways, and if it doesn't, you just made $30 without even having to buy anything.",reaper527,1,/r/stocks/comments/m6wd4h/need_help_understanding_selling_ccs_sounds_too/gr9fzp5/,0.047,0.825,0.128,0.9843

453,CC," No problem at all! I felt similar when I heard about them for the first time. 

I‘ve been testing the strategy on a paper account for some time now, while trying to find a  good company where the needed investment is reasonable. You‘ll notice that it’s not really as good as it sounds at first - which in no way means it’s bad, just not too good to be true. 

It can be tricky to find the right strike price, and naturally, those that are likely to end ITM are worth much more, which is tempting. 

One thing that you might have missed (I‘m just assuming since you didn’t mention it anywhere) is the possibility to roll a call. If it ends ITM but you don’t want to sell your shares, you can buy it back close to expiration day for about the difference between market and strike. That means you will lose the difference between market and strike, minus the premium you got. That way, you can keep your stocks and sell the next CC right away!

Companies faced a massive suppression on margins/earnings due to lockdown mandates which inflates P/E significantly in certain sectors. You either believe that’s short lived, or you believe the company/sector is fundamentally changed forever, which probably guides how you view companies. I think both will be true for various companies and that the market will react in time.

The entire political landscape did shift, which is driving optimism towards increased ESG investment/spend seeing as how that aligns with potential Dem policy spend.

Id start by watching how other ppl that broke the market made their first million, there is a nice one about Warren Buffet on yt. 

Small cap is definitely the way to go imo, options are too much of a zero sum game. There is a fine balance to find between growth and value, but basically what your are looking for is informations that aren’t priced in yet. This is where a solid grasp of accounting and fundamentals are important, because it can gives you metrics on how to price information you find that the general market isn’t aware, again there is less competition in small caps and its easier to find value in NRs and other analysts work. Being gullible is costly with small cap, everyone has the next revolutionary product, the only sure this is: **money talk**

look for contracts with other reliable companies or governments, unrealized but realistic backlog,  current assets value vs market cap, etc... once you went throught 100+ of companies in good sectors, you will fall in love eventually, thats the hard and beautiful part, hoping you found the right one, its time to take risk.

Now is the time to get married, you are almost certain you are early/ the market is late. You need to commit, like they say: concentrate to get rich and diversify to stay it. You can manage 2 or 3 wifes but more than that and itll be too hard to manage, remember you are married, you are committed, you have conviction , divorcing will cost you half your home so be ready to wait years before saying you were wrong, coz you weren’t, the rest of the market is, you know there is something not being priced in, now you need other ppl to know it too, share your discovery like you would share your wife lmao, with ppl that will respect her while telling her story.

All that needs lots of work and mostly lots of luck, you might be in a failed mariage and in this case you did a terrible mistake that will cost you years of you time(money), or you could have a widly successful wife that becomes the next korean pop star or something, that makes ppl ask you of the hell did a guy like you ended with that! And your answer should be she just needed a bit of love and some confidence while finishing her makeup. 


Hope this dont sound too stupid lmao, still lore reliable than yoloing in call options in the next tesla. At least if you lose everything with wifey, you learned a lot during the way, you didn’t just bought a lottery ticket, you bought education. And Hopefully after a little break you can go back on tinder until you know you found the next woman you want to share your life with.

Move in and out of positions by increments, have high conviction, dont be too much of an idiot (a lil bit of one aint that bad either) and always, always be an ultra cheap fuck, there is no way youll get five bagger+ without being super cheap while buying.

Or, you may feel that ARKK is likely to perform better in the near term, and believe that CRSP is unlikely to break out imminently or ever. In the first case, you would likely hold.

I haven’t bothered with stop loss because the stocks I pick aren’t high risk,  but that could be a flaw in my strategy too.
