67,SP," I've been in and out of positions over the past few months.  There has been a lot of money to be made.  The concept of the coin seems good.  They are a profitable mining company underneath it all so they can back coins with gold below market cost and survive as a business in general.  They aren't ""all-in"" on this for survival even if it seems like their SP is.  They also have low/no debt and decent financials for these types of stocks.  

The major bear cases are company image and ability to push the coin long-term.  The name is admittedly weak in the current environment of suspicion of Asian, or really Chinese, penny stocks and it doesn't connect to the selling point of their business.  They lack a strong web presence.  If their CEO was a Twitter warrior, I bet the price would be much higher.

The coin is selling, albeit slowly, despite not even being exchangeable back to other crypto at this time.  If they can get that running, it becomes more marketable as people swap from cryptos to the coin and back based on what they want to trade.  Those fees will be decent revenue on top of the pure profit involved in the initial coin release (they already had all the gold on hand so all coin purchases are cash in their pocket).  If they get the final infrastructure pieces in place and then go on a coin marketing blitz, they could be a winner....

But pennies are driven, at least in part, by hype so the SP short-term is really hard to judge.  It's had runs lately based on hype that has now faded a bit so it needs some big catalyst to get attention back if you are looking to make big gains on the scale of days/weeks rather than months.  Various examples I've seen mentioned are audits/uplisting, release of the exchange (probably a big one), revamping website and adding more management (seems needed) and the coin marketing campaign.

The price is pretty stable right now on no news so I don't think some massive drop is looming...but I don't know if I would skip a more sure, short-term play to go all-in.  Maybe small position to start.  You can always add later.",MAMark1,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/n1th9a/what_do_you_guys_think_of_aabb/gwgv2ow/,0.037,0.878,0.085,0.9477

101,CBD," You'll have to forgive me, its early, I've yet to have my coffee, and this is not my field of expertise but I'll try to give my two cents.

In the discussion you provided, not as much a study as a summary of their pending results they will be presenting, they go on to talk about Willow CBG vs CBD. A couple things on this. This study is apparently not an apple's to apple's study. Willow seems to be comparing their CBG to conventional CBD and are noting the differences. Unfortunately, these differences are already well established. As for all of the claims, I can not speak to as biopharma is not my field, but the antimicrobial and antibacterial properties of CBG are well known, especially in the medical fields. There is research into CBG being used as alternative antibacterial to resistant strains as well as cancer research for the manner that CBG interacts with certain receptors in the body.

The last thing I will throw out is that without getting into the gritty science, CBD (as well as THC and a few others) come from CBG. In the cannabis plant, CBG forms first and through different stages of growth and botany based magic I am unaware of, it is transformed into these other cannabinoids. While similar to one another, they are not the same. 

In short, this study is basically saying, look at this banana! It is a great source to reduce muscle cramps, much better so than this apple for this banana is much higher in potassium.

116,BP," You my friend have just learned that Royalty Trusts aren‚Äôt actual companies.

A Royalty Trust is sold on the Stock Market but is not an actual company.  It is a legal entity with interest in a defined interest in the royalties of a defined set of assets (mines or oil wells almost always).  They have special tax considerations.  As part of thar arrangement, they cannot expand or grow by the legal terms of the trust.  This is because the trust is intended to have a higher rate of return than something like bond, but lower risks than operating an actual company to protect the royalty investors.

A company will setup a royalty trust and sell it to get some immediate money for operations without selling a true interest in themselves.  Often the company that initiated it is the designated operator of the mine or oil wells underneath it.  Look at Diamondback and Viper in the oil industry to see an example.  

The yields in good years are very good.  In mining and drilling, they normally get the first cut above a certain amount of production (usually set around estimated break even).  They have very low capital and operating expenses, so their profit margin is crazy good when the underlying asset is above break even.  

At the end of a defined term, the trust is normally designed to liquidate itself after a set time or amount of productivity or drop in productivity.  Sometimes they give the remaining value to all investors.  Sometimes they  can renew themselves if the assets are still productive.  Other times the forming company has all of the remaining assets returned at the Trust expiry.

I held one that was very good on the surface called MVO at one point for a month that I sold for a decent profit.  I  sold in the Ex-Dividend date before a big Dividend jump.  I found out in the nick of time this last tidbit.

Trusts have very complicated tax implications with their dividends because they technically aren‚Äôt dividends.  They are distributions.  MVO is based on wells in Kansas and Oklahoma.  You make money on them and you could be exposed to personal taxes in those states.  I realized that the cost for my accountant to sort that out exceeded my dividend upside and sold it.  Buying and selling for taxes is fairly normal if you don‚Äôt collect a dividend.  

Also productivity or the supply drops or the mine/well goes dry, they make no money at all.  BP Prudhoe Bay has a trust that has been in this condition for years.  It will expire early because that specific trust terminates after so many years if unproductive, and the assests don‚Äôt go back to the investors.  Its still around $3 US.  I have to assume a lot of people don‚Äôt understand their risk in holding on to it, or their is some other factor I don‚Äôt understand and don‚Äôt want to.  

Royalty Trusts aren‚Äôt inherently bad.  But for a small investor, stay the hell away.  There are more ways to lose than win if you don‚Äôt specialize in them.",ReadStoriesAndStuff,4,/r/pennystocks/comments/n1vby0/i_need_some_advice_on_something_and_this_seems_to/gwg4mk5/,0.073,0.723,0.204,0.9977
