**[Concerning Apes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pGaz_qN0cw)**

Apes have been living and farming in the four Farthings of Reddit for many hundreds of years. Quite content to ignore and be ignored by the world of the Bulls and Bears ‚Äî Corporate America being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count. Apes must seem of little importance, being neither renowned as great warriors, nor counted among the very wise.

In fact, it has been remarked by some that the Apes' only real passion is for Bananas. A rather unfair observation, as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of juice, and the smoking of crayons. But where our hearts truly lie is in peace and quiet, and good tilled DD. For all Apes share a love of Stonks that üöÄüöÄüöÄ.

And yes, no doubt, to others our ways seem quaint. But today, of all days, it is brought home to me, it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.

**8:30 Pre-Market Update**

GME does not care that the markets have closed. While the North American Apes were sleeping, the Europan, Asian, Australian, and African Apes continue to fuel the üöÄ, pushing GME's price to around 285. It has since leveled out around 277.

[Some apes are speculating that Short Interest compared to the Float may still be over 200%.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m19sa7/true_short_interest_in_gee_em_ee_could_be/) Available shorts according to [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) show that there are 850,000 shorts available. This number will be updated at around 9:04 with this morning's short activity. According to [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/), there are 45.16 million float shares. Regardless of what the actual Short% is, I feel confident to say that there are still too many shorts still outstanding and that GME's momentum should continue. Those shorts must be bought eventually, and the Apes will decide how much they will sell their üçåüçåüçå for.

* Shorts available: 850,000

* Price at Close: 246.90

* Current Pre-Market Price: 277.74

**9:07 Pre-Market Update**

500,000 shorts were opened premarket. This might explain why premarket prices are around 266. Don't be surprised if there is a dip at the start of the Bell.

* Shorts available: 350,000

* Current premarket price: 266.63 (corrected)

The North American Apes follow the rest of the world Apes into a frenzy. 500,000 did nothing to slow GME's ascent and is continuing it's upward trajectory. The Short Hedge Investors and Traders (SHITs or SHITers) are in serious trouble as the Apes continue to demand more and more for their stock. The growth has been exponential and there is no end in sight. 

* Shorts available: 350,000

* Current price: 290.82

**Update 10:51**

A small 50,000 sedative short shot was injected into the Apes, which took the stock below 290 for a small bit. After being dazed for a bit, the Apes have continued their rampage, demanding the price go above 295. Upward momentum is still in full force, though it might not be as strong as opening bell. Once the shot wears off, we might see another climb.

* Shorts available: 300,000

* Current price: 294.00

**Update 11:25**

Welcome back onboard $300 Apes. It is truly a beautiful sight to see Apes band together and care for one another. The apes continue the climb, eyeing Apes left at 400 and beyond. What an incredible story for the Apes. You don't see this kind of community with Bears or Bulls. Apes truly care for one another and want nothing but üçåüçåüçå for all.

* Shorts available: 300,000

üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

They used 50,000 shorts, but Apes don't care. GME is nearly $100 ahead of where it ended yesterday and it's showing no signs of slowing down. GME might break 400 before EOD.

* Shorts available: 250,000

* Current price : 340.26

**Update 12:23 Halt**

That was strange. This is where I wish I knew how long shorts borrowed have until they enter the market. Remember how they borrowed 500,000 prior to opening bell? I wouldn't be surprised if all those were just fired at GME in a coordinated attack. This also happens during lunch? Seems suspicious to me. We'll definitely have more information as time goes on, but this is definitely a strange development. We'll see how GME reacts after the halt.

GME just exited the halt and things are volatile. Please buckle up and hold on tight. 

* Shorts available: 250,000

* Current price: 276.00

**Update 12:31 Halt #2**

Holy shit. We're at another halt. This seems like a really desperate attempt to cut off the GME fuel. I don't think anyone legit believes that drop was natural.

* Shorts available: 200,000

* Current price: 248.68

**Update 12:36 Halt #3**

ANOTHER HALT! GME is now down 30 from where it ended yesterday. The SHITers need to do something drastic and this is it. They're trying to get people to panic sell. They're trying to get people to leave their position. I don't think anyone is buying it though. This is so clearly manipulation.

97,EVER," Good morning, retards.

Also, good morning CNBC, HFs, etc.   Allow me to explain a few things for you, because you still aren't understanding anything.  Over the last week, 2 things have been said on here that I'd like to repeat, and you to think about:

**""They entered a battle of attrition with  a generation of people with fuck all to lose...""**

*(Editor's note:  More than a generation.  It's not just zoomers.  I'm Gen X, you've all been fucking us over for a very long time.)*

AND

**""They shorted gamers.  GAMERS.""**

I can make back what I put in within 2 days.  I put in $398, total, as that was all I had, and still all I have to put in this at the time.  And if I were to sell to break even, or even get just a little over that, NOTHING in my life changes.

OR

I could say, ""fuck it, what do I have to lose"", and hodl as long as necessary to see where this goes, and maybe, just maybe, come out with a whole lot more than I started with or have EVER had, all at once, in my lifetime.

If I lose out, I just work 2 extra days.  My life stays the same, I just had fun for a little while.

But if I don't lose - EVERYTHING CHANGES.

I kind of think it's worth it since the worst I'm out is having to work 2 days I might normally take off.

There is no panic on this side of it.  There is panic on your side of it.

I literally can hold a lot longer than you can scowl, look down at us, and wag  your finger in our face.

I do not have a single thing to lose here, and everything to gain.

Edit:  Woah.  My first gold!  Thank you, ape.  I have no idea what to do with gold, but I appreciate it.  Wish I could put it towards GME.

Edit 2:  wtf is happening?  Another gold?  Thank you!  I wrote this after watching that smug bastard on CNBC try to claim we were doing something illegal.  It pissed me off, so I had to say something.

Also, good morning CNBC, HFs, etc.   Allow me to explain a few things for you, because you still aren't understanding anything.  Over the last week, 2 things have been said on here that I'd like to repeat, and you to think about:

**""They entered a battle of attrition with  a generation of people with fuck all to lose...""**

*(Editor's note:  More than a generation.  It's not just zoomers.  I'm Gen X, you've all been fucking us over for a very long time.)*

AND

**""They shorted gamers.  GAMERS.""**

I can make back what I put in within 2 days.  I put in $398, total, as that was all I had, and still all I have to put in this at the time.  And if I were to sell to break even, or even get just a little over that, NOTHING in my life changes.

OR

I could say, ""fuck it, what do I have to lose"", and hodl as long as necessary to see where this goes, and maybe, just maybe, come out with a whole lot more than I started with or have EVER had, all at once, in my lifetime.

If I lose out, I just work 2 extra days.  My life stays the same, I just had fun for a little while.

But if I don't lose - EVERYTHING CHANGES.

I kind of think it's worth it since the worst I'm out is having to work 2 days I might normally take off.

There is no panic on this side of it.  There is panic on your side of it.

I literally can hold a lot longer than you can scowl, look down at us, and wag  your finger in our face.

I do not have a single thing to lose here, and everything to gain.

Those of us who are investors in GME aren't making comments like,  "" Look how much it dropped its so unfair""

 **The real investors,**  remember the previous GME squeeze and we know what happened was a desperate attempt by shorts to flood the market with short shares to drop the price.  This is actually, a good sign.  We have all seen this before. On January 27th.  

  If you are reading this,  trust in us Apes who lived through the first squeeze and seen the 8-9 circuit breaker halts in a day combined with sudden massive volume increases as the price dropped.   This is new short positions being opened.  If you want to profit, and win.

 Do one of these things or both.

1. Do not sell.

119,GME," Can I just take a moment to say that above learned more about the actual stock market since January than I have in the entire preceding year. As a young investor, just starting out in my career, just starting to really invest, I have passively researched and slowly learned the basics about the Greeks, value trading vs growth, dollar cost averaging. 

But none of it really ever sunk in until I found WSB and decided to pick the bug from my fellow apes head and take a bite. My first bite was to FOMO GME at $350. My portfolio crashed, like everyone else, and while I was 80% down, I didn‚Äôt sell. I listened, I read, I learned. 

I found out about FUD. Wow. Like really, media is not on my side. They tried to say that you all were playing me and making me a bag holder. You said, üíéüíéü§≤üèº, we‚Äôre coming back for you. For whatever reason, that comradely from strangers broke through the BS that was popping up on my news feed and made me dig deeper. 

I learned about the MACD, and about averaging down. I got my GME under $100 and then just buckled up and enjoyed life. 

And here you all come, like a group of toddlers riding the short bus, and you picked me up from my corner, lunch box with a single banana in hand. And we kept driving 

So now, 300+ gang. Believe me, the short bus is coming for you. The tendie man cometh. 


Edit: sorry for the above, my 3 year old grabbed my phone and just started typing.

I‚Äôm here to encourage my other silent friends who may be in the same boat as me and want to peel off. DONT. I‚Äôve read all of the DD. I know it‚Äôs good. Conquer your fears. 

Also - do not forget about the taxes on capital gains. Ole Uncle Sam is gonna come peel your panties off if you sell for small profits. 


Just want to thank you all here for the confirmation bias and bringing me along for the ride. I‚Äôm not here to say I‚Äôm going to do some whacky stunt or eat a horse penis. It‚Äôs a crazy and stressful and whacky ride. My wife is tired of hearing me talk about it.

Apes have been living and farming in the four Farthings of Reddit for many hundreds of years. Quite content to ignore and be ignored by the world of the Bulls and Bears ‚Äî Corporate America being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count. Apes must seem of little importance, being neither renowned as great warriors, nor counted among the very wise.

In fact, it has been remarked by some that the Apes' only real passion is for Bananas. A rather unfair observation, as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of juice, and the smoking of crayons. But where our hearts truly lie is in peace and quiet, and good tilled DD. For all Apes share a love of Stonks that üöÄüöÄüöÄ.

Together, Ape Strong

**8:30 Pre-Market Update**

GME does not care that the markets have closed. While the North American Apes were sleeping, the Europan, Asian, Australian, and African Apes continue to fuel the üöÄ, pushing GME's price to around 285. It has since leveled out around 277.

[Some apes are speculating that Short Interest compared to the Float may still be over 200%.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m19sa7/true_short_interest_in_gee_em_ee_could_be/) Available shorts according to [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) show that there are 850,000 shorts available. This number will be updated at around 9:04 with this morning's short activity. According to [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/), there are 45.16 million float shares. Regardless of what the actual Short% is, I feel confident to say that there are still too many shorts still outstanding and that GME's momentum should continue. Those shorts must be bought eventually, and the Apes will decide how much they will sell their üçåüçåüçå for.

* Shorts available: 850,000

* Price at Close: 246.90

The North American Apes follow the rest of the world Apes into a frenzy. 500,000 did nothing to slow GME's ascent and is continuing it's upward trajectory.

A small 50,000 sedative short shot was injected into the Apes, which took the stock below 290 for a small bit. After being dazed for a bit, the Apes have continued their rampage, demanding the price go above 295. Upward momentum is still in full force, though it might not be as strong as opening bell.

So the shorts available have not changed according to IBorrowDesk. What this means is that the SHITs are getting their shorts from somewhere else, or the 500,000 that were borrowed in pre-market were held back until the lunch attack. This way, the number on IBorrowDesk doesn't change right after the drop, so it can look like it wasn't them. I'm willing to bet money that a good portion if not all of those 500,000 shorts were used during the lunch attack.

GME is recovering from that blast and is making it's way back towards 300. We'll see if the trajectory has changed after the attack.

**Update 1:46**

GME had been floating around 270, however another 50,000 shorts were borrowed. This might explain the dip down to below 260. The volatility seems to have evened out enough for this to make sense. Please realize that regardless of where GME ends up today, 750,000 shorts were fired at GME today, and the price is still up 8% from yesterday's close. They are at 150,000 shorts left. They are running out of ammo and GME is still climbing. We might be reaching the end game.

* Shorts available: 150,000

Downward momentum lately pushing below 250. It was stable around 265 for a good bit. This might be another short attack. 

* Shorts available: 150,000

* Current price: 236.70

**3:00 Update**

GME dropped down to around 225 before starting it's slow recovery back up. This might be an attack from remnants from the shorts borrowed earlier today. We're not seeing drops in shorts available. With this post being popular, the SHITers might be onto how we gather information on their moves and are trying to mask their intentions. I'm pretty sure there is math available where we can figure out the short to price change ratio to be able to figure out how many shorts they fire during a short attack. I'm going to think on this and see if I can figure out a process to figure this out. I'm pretty sure it's doable, but probably involves some complicated math.

If we can figure out that equation, we would be able to estimate how many shorts are being pumped into GME on every attack. We can then figure out how much ammo they truly have left.

Apes have been living and farming in the four Farthings of Reddit for many hundreds of years. Quite content to ignore and be ignored by the world of the Bulls and Bears ‚Äî Corporate America being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count. Apes must seem of little importance, being neither renowned as great warriors, nor counted among the very wise.

In fact, it has been remarked by some that the Apes' only real passion is for Bananas. A rather unfair observation, as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of juice, and the smoking of crayons. But where our hearts truly lie is in peace and quiet, and good tilled DD. For all Apes share a love of Stonks that üöÄüöÄüöÄ.

**8:30 Pre-Market Update**

GME does not care that the markets have closed. While the North American Apes were sleeping, the Europan, Asian, Australian, and African Apes continue to fuel the üöÄ, pushing GME's price to around 285. It has since leveled out around 277.

[Some apes are speculating that Short Interest compared to the Float may still be over 200%.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m19sa7/true_short_interest_in_gee_em_ee_could_be/) Available shorts according to [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) show that there are 850,000 shorts available. This number will be updated at around 9:04 with this morning's short activity. According to [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/), there are 45.16 million float shares. Regardless of what the actual Short% is, I feel confident to say that there are still too many shorts still outstanding and that GME's momentum should continue.

* Shorts available: 150,000

* Current price: 266.65

**2:20 Update**

Downward momentum lately pushing below 250. It was stable around 265 for a good bit. This might be another short attack. 

* Shorts available: 150,000

* Current price: 236.70

**3:00 Update**

GME dropped down to around 225 before starting it's slow recovery back up. This might be an attack from remnants from the shorts borrowed earlier today. We're not seeing drops in shorts available. With this post being popular, the SHITers might be onto how we gather information on their moves and are trying to mask their intentions. I'm pretty sure there is math available where we can figure out the short to price change ratio to be able to figure out how many shorts they fire during a short attack. I'm going to think on this and see if I can figure out a process to figure this out. I'm pretty sure it's doable, but probably involves some complicated math.

If we can figure out that equation, we would be able to estimate how many shorts are being pumped into GME on every attack. We can then figure out how much ammo they truly have left.

* Shorts available: 150,000

* Current price: 257.72

253,GME," We knew this would happen, that they would try to short the stock to make us think ""oh that's it, that was the squeeze""
  
What they actually just did what fuck themselves over a hundred times. 

GME dipped -19%, and if you remember, a 10% drop from previous close at any time during the day places it on the short sale restriction list -- which means they can only short on upticks today and tomorrow
  
They're still trying to sell at this time to shake paper hands out and kill momentum, they were hoping for a bigger impact, but all they were able to do was drop the price down to what it was yesterday

295,AMC," My explanation for why there was such a large dip:

Volume was WAY too low to cause such a huge drop in price, so I asked in GME Megathread Part 1, ""How could that large of a dip happen, with such a low volume?"", also pointing out that [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) didn't report any new shorts, during the time of the dip. I didn't realize that when shorts are borrowed, the borrower has 3 days to use them, or they have to be returned. Shorts HAVE been borrowed, in large numbers, over the past few days. That means that hedgies were borrowing shorted shares, iron handing them, borrowing more, and then they released them all at once (or in large chunks because of the halts). That allowed them to tank the price in a very direct and focused manner, say $160 in a matter of 20 minutes (and that includes the halt times). I believe this was an attempt to trigger stop losses and scare day-traders into selling. The immediate rebound and the fact that THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED TO AMC, AT THE SAME TIME, seems to corroborate this theory.

Thanks to /u/_Exordium, for explaining this rule for borrowing shorts!

TLDR: Since there has been millions of shares shorted over the past few days, and they have 3 days to use the shorted shares, I think that the dip was caused by hedgies hoarding shorts to release all at once. Thus tanking the price and triggering stop losses and scaring day-traders into paperhanding.

296,AT," My explanation for why there was such a large dip:

Volume was WAY too low to cause such a huge drop in price, so I asked in GME Megathread Part 1, ""How could that large of a dip happen, with such a low volume?"", also pointing out that [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) didn't report any new shorts, during the time of the dip. I didn't realize that when shorts are borrowed, the borrower has 3 days to use them, or they have to be returned. Shorts HAVE been borrowed, in large numbers, over the past few days. That means that hedgies were borrowing shorted shares, iron handing them, borrowing more, and then they released them all at once (or in large chunks because of the halts). That allowed them to tank the price in a very direct and focused manner, say $160 in a matter of 20 minutes (and that includes the halt times). I believe this was an attempt to trigger stop losses and scare day-traders into selling. The immediate rebound and the fact that THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED TO AMC, AT THE SAME TIME, seems to corroborate this theory.

Thanks to /u/_Exordium, for explaining this rule for borrowing shorts!

369,GME," **3:21 Update**

The short to price change ratio is difficult to figure out because there are a couple of things we need to know.

1) How does changing the total shares in the market affect the price.

2) How does the rate of shorts added affect the price.

3) How does the change in price affect options and how MMs buy and sell shares to try to remain neutral. (Which means actually understanding Greeks....)

4) How does public sentiment during an attack affect the price.

5) I'm sure there are other things I haven't even considered because nobody actually taught me how money and the stock market works.

One thing we haven't considered is how that shake up affected MMs and options. That attack might have been an attempt, not to cause a panic, but to stifle a compounding Gamma Squeeze. That might explain why it was so obvious. That might be why GME has stabalized at around 255. It might be a signal that GME is on the verge of a heart attack.

I might also not know anything and be completely wrong, but speculating is more fun.

I really should get back to work....

* Shorts available: 150,000

* Current price: 253.61

**4:23 Closing Bell Update**

50,000 shorts were pulled out then put back in, probably what drove the price down before ending at 265. This is lower than where GME was at earlier today, but this is higher than we were yesterday even after accounting for the massive short attack today. What will the SHITers do tomorrow with only 150,000 shorta available? Honestly, I have no idea. That massive attack still did not stop the overall trajectory, and they'll have to reload before injecting another shot.

Journey before destination. We all want our tendies, but learning why the process works the way it does will help us navigate through future endeavors. The best part about this sub has been how we collectively have all been learning so much about how the financial world really works. We've used one another as guides to help us learn and grow together. Stay strong apes, for the future is at hand.

464,USA," I really hope this gets investigated. Looks like a coordinated dump on 4 companies out of nowhere.  

Either those that bought in at $350 set a limit sell at $330 trying to limit their losses or some rather large entity dumped near enough 10m shares at once. I was in the car watching the shares volume at 29m and at the time of the price dump and second halt the volume had jumped up to 41m.  

SEC best pull their finger out and i hope all you beautiful apes in the USA write to your representatives, congress and the senate to make complaints about this clear abuse of power.   

For arguments sake lets say Melvin Capital decided to cause this attack. They know the SEC fine would be nothing compared to the huge gains they most likely made from it. If it wasn't a single person it could've been multiple companies dumping the stock. Not only this but how the flying kanagroo can CNBC run a full story within 2 minutes about the specfics? Did they have 10 different stories laying around waiting for the all clear to post as to get the correct one? Or do they have superman typing up stories these days? Did they know their money benefactor was about to do this so had a story ready to go?

585,RKT," So when someone calls into CNBCs Mad Money with Jim Cramer and asks if they should buy Boeing, and jimmy shill smacks his big ole BUY BUY BUY button and there‚Äôs a a couple hundred thousand people watching, that‚Äôs not illegal but people reading through research and memes and deciding on their own to buy a stock should be illegal?  What?

Edit: and my point here is, it‚Äôs obvious that CNBC and these anchors are controlled by hedgefunds and big money.  Jimmy Shill even says so.

I called her she met me outside, she said ‚Äúthanks‚Äù, like it was no big deal. Then just put the stuff on her cart at rolled away. She just gave me a blank receipt and told me I could fill it out myself. I half assumed she just wheeled it out to her car. I know it‚Äôs more about the donation and what it was doing for the kids, but damn it was just so ‚Äúnothing‚Äù to them and unenthusiastic. Just very unfulfilling I guess.

694,GME," I have not fully mentally processed what could happen Friday if we break pace/balance MMs and Hedgies have struck. ( and Friday for the ITM calls that will get exercised) and where that would  leave  us on Monday.  

this is assuming well, a lot. mostly that MM's  can be hurt by a GME  Gamma squeeze in a ""short zone""  just as much as the hedge funds. basically MM's will be holding hedge funds feet to the flames for the liquidity they need to cover the Gamma.  

TLDR:  I would expect  January 27th levels of volatility/problems if they break pace.  and I would want to be near a computer  for that.

695,GME," 1,000 people each have contracts to buy 100 shares of GME from Joe Call-Seller for $300.

GME breaks $300.  We'll say $320 just because.

Those 1,000 people can each now buy 100 shares of GME from Joe for $300.  Since GME is worth $320 dollars, buying it for only $300 is a pretty good deal, so they exercise those contracts.

That means that Joe Call-Seller needs to buy 100,000 shares of GME to fulfil the contracts and give each one of those 1,000 people their 100 shares.

Buying 100,000 shares pushes the price up.  Now the price is $350.

Uh-oh.  1,000 people also had contracts to buy 100 shares of GME from Joe Call-Seller for $340.  Now that GME is worth $350, they exercise those contracts.

Joe Call-Seller now needs to buy another 100,000 shares of GME for fulfill those contracts.  

Buying 100,000 shares pushes the price up.  Now the price is $400.

Which means that all of the $380 calls are now in the money... That keeps going until we get to all those $800 calls people are talking about. 

That is an overly simplified explanation of a gamma squeeze.

If you want a slightly more accurate explanation: Joe Call-Seller (the market maker) doesn't want to get fucked, so he buys shares to cover his ass before things even get exercised.  As he buys things to cover his ass, the price goes up, causing more people to buy options which causes more share-buying to cover which causes more options to go ITM.

[edit] I'm glad you guys are finding this helpful.  I teach high school, so explaining things to smooth brains is my thing.  Remember, though, that this is a basic explanation of a gamma squeeze, and the real mechanism is more complicated than this.  This will give you the basic conceptual idea of how it works, but you aren't an expert in gamma squeezes after reading this.

828,GME," So here's my opinion on it. Yes, they pushed the entire industry towards a zero commission model and made trading far more accessible. Both of these are good things, but I absolutely will not pick my broker on the good things they did in the past, I'll pick based on what they're doing now. 

So, what do they have good going for them? Really, the only major positive is that their interface is fucking beautiful and super intuitive. 

As far as bad things go, I dont really give a fuck about the whole GME situation but if that matters to you then that. The three biggest things for me are 1) they have a history of going down during high trading volume. Not all the time, but more than pretty much every other major broker I'm aware of. Considering these high volume times are often times of high market volatility, this is frankly unacceptable. 2) they have basically the worst fills out of all the major brokers. If you only trade shares, this probably wont matter to you, but if you trade options or spreads RH's slippage can actually cost you even more than the commissions on most brokers. And 3) although their interface is very clean, it lacks alot of useful tools that other brokers offer. 

I have nothing necessarily against RH, but I chose to leave it a while back and I generally encourage others to as well.

Edit: also they have the worst customer service of all the brokers, which is a big deal when they're responsible for 10's of thousands of your dollars",danfay222,47,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1pnai/my_first_million_dollar_week_mars_no_show_me/gqf3dki/,0.071,0.744,0.185,0.9892

There are no taxes even on a withdrawal from a TFSA - this is one of the key differences with an RRSP. 

> They‚Äôre going to keep an eye on his trading activity, seeing if it‚Äôs dumb luck or if he‚Äôs a savvy investor, etc and potentially coming after him. 

This is closer to the truth (I said something along those lines in another comment).

Even being a savvy investor isn't likely to be a major factor, but as you said:

Exactly, I have had ridiculous gains but the real point I was making and responding to with the GP was it's above my yearly limit.

>When you pull any money out of there, you‚Äôre going to be paying tax at your marginal tax rate and foregoing the 50% capital gains and you also forego the ability to carry back/forward losses so they‚Äôre not coming after you. 

There are no taxes even on a withdrawal from a TFSA - this is one of the key differences with an RRSP. 

> They‚Äôre going to keep an eye on his trading activity, seeing if it‚Äôs dumb luck or if he‚Äôs a savvy investor, etc and potentially coming after him. 

This is closer to the truth (I said something along those lines in another comment).

Even being a savvy investor isn't likely to be a major factor, but as you said:

this is the basis for what has been going on with GME.  the more the price of GME goes up, the more the hedge funds who shorted it get screwed, because eventually they will have to return the shares that they have borrowed (and reborrowed so many times) and sold short at lower prices (which they thought were comparatively high prices at the time).  it‚Äôs particularly messy in this instance because of how many times they have collectively done it.

He agreed, then he said ""a friend said this is going to go down"" and stopped replying for some time.

Don't even hold a grudge for that as it was indeed much riskier and it would've taken years before I see any gains and I would have to struggle with my shitty PC until then. However I am still fucking pissed about GME and I doubt I'd ever forgive him for that.

Trading and economy in general has never been our strongest suit but we know how numbers are. I'm not gonna lie, I personally came to get the scoop on GME because if I'm going to gamble, this is the best roulette table in the casino. In a real casino I know I'm getting mathematically fucked, I lose money by participating because the odds are fucking me in the ass. So before I went all in on GME, I knew I could lose a majority of my investment, but stand to gain significanlty more than a 100% returns, if that's not a profitable gamble, I don't know what is. I just want to finance my studies. 

I don't plan on doing heavy investing in the future, maybe biotech/420 stocks since biotech is my field and I used to grow for profit so I know a thing or two about the process from seed to flower. 

Oh and my old man couldn't give a fuck about the vision of the company, even if he tried. He grew up poor and the concept of fluctuating value is literally too stressful for him.

Now, it gets worse, there's several eCommerce giants GME can't compete against, even if they go niche their market share is gonna be very small.

All in all this is a stock that will crash sooner or later, unless the squeeze continues forever which is not gonna happen, your father was somewhat right when saying Cohen just hyped it, but realistically it doesn't matter too much, say GME becomes somewhat relevant again and their shares recover some value, they're still in a worse position than they were 15 years ago.",Kachingloool,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1igxk/gme_yolo_update_my_dad_still_says_that_were_all/gqfjb0l/,0.055,0.853,0.092,0.6312

I was in college around this time and didn't realize that he was sacrificing his 401k for my and my brother's tuition.   
In the last year, after suffering from a few ischemic strokes and undergoing heart surgery, I watched how the stress of trying to keep up with everything by ""doing everything right"" as far as ""the American dream"" goes- took such a massive toll on his body and mind. The day after his FMLA ran out he was supposed to return to work.. but was informed instead that they had already replaced his position (they had found a legal way to do this without any severance).

Chicago (futures market) were laughing claiming all these premiums in the now for calls that would never be in the money.... right?

Hedge funds noticed this, decided to go long GME to squeeze Chicago and their competitor hedge funds and thats what set off the price from $40 to $91 and then the subsequent rise to where we are today.

The price only needs to hit -10% at any point in the day when compared to the previous days close for SSR to go into affect; the closing price is irrelevant for SSR. So, GME dropped more than 10% at one point today. Therefore, SSR is in affect for the rest of today and all of tomorrow.

Keep in mind, SSR only makes it harder to short and can only be shorted when going up. If the stock is going down, they cannot short. It doesn‚Äôt matter if the stock has recovered or not. Think of it as only being able to short a green bar and not being allowed to short a red bar.

1241,GME," Nobody learned their lesson the first time. When GME settled back down in the 100 range, they all shorted again. Because if it made sense to short at $40 it made more sense to short at $100. But this time they shorted even more to make back the gains they lost last time.

Their hubris is understandable. After all, we‚Äôre just a bunch of retards, and they‚Äôre seasoned financial investors. All the same, their hubris will bring their demise.

I think this will be a slow climb this time, for whatever reason. No DD, but this thing has just been slowly building and especially after the DTCC news. I think the slow climb is to sort of reinforce the raise in the price, filling the buy side with more points that would be more difficult to offset with shorts and to give people confidence necessary to HODL and keep the float low.

It just feels like this is meant to be a slow moving juggernaut which says to me there's no force rushing this thing along to new highs.

The media would be straight on the spin, label GME investors as terrorists, alt right, whatever buzzword they use. Politicians will not care either, they don't want a massive stock market crash.

Lastly. Hedges are on both side of this trade. Short positions are fucked to say the least as this keeps rising, but they will have a plan and unless they are margin called (and I believe there will be a step in before that) they will just bite the interest for the time being, so the larger players will just be able to sit through it, smaller players get squeezed out.

On the other side of the trade, institutional investors will want to protect their other investments. They will pull their big investments at specific prices. They will end up with 100s of millions regardless and can just call of the risk for the sake of a massive gain. They don't want a bunch of hedge funds being forced to liquidate positions in other stocks and potentially bring the price of other investments down to big investors who are long.

Over $1,000 for a few days seems very likely, but I don't believe anyone (gov, wall street, etc) is letting $100,000/share happen, whether it mathematically should or not.",htx1114,22,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1waof/this_is_why_gamestop_wont_stop_and_why_100k_is/gqg1f05/,0.036,0.916,0.048,0.1531

1296,GME," You don't understand.  The hedge funds' short positions aren't borrowed from retail investors, they are borrowed from institutional investors whose long positions are well above that $250,000 SIPC limit.  If the shorts go bankrupt, **most of those shorts will be written off instead of being covered**.  Institutional investor accounts will be zeroed out because the shares they loaned out no longer exist.  Long story short, the short squeeze will be aborted/canceled.

Your GME shares will be safe, sitting in a cash account.  If you are lucky, you might be able to sell them during this process.  If you are unlucky, you will lose access to your GME shares for months and won't be able to sell until the whole ordeal has been dealt with.",taedrin,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1waof/this_is_why_gamestop_wont_stop_and_why_100k_is/gqg5kbc/,0.062,0.833,0.105,0.5994

At some point it became obvious that it wasn‚Äôt worth throwing in the towel as they will either throw in the towel, or have the towel thrown in for them when they go bankrupt. But as long as the match continues there is always the slight chance that either an outside official stops the match (bailout/forgiveness from SEC or govt) or their opponent (Apes) slip on their own sweat (paper hand) or get struck by lighting from a divine being (paper hand).

If I was a HF manager that‚Äôs the legitimate mathematical play. You‚Äôll never recoup the losses and exit the position legally in any reasonable amount of time or way that doesn‚Äôt lead to bankruptcy so why get out? Just like people holding onto stocks the have 100% of their portfolio In drop super low. Selling only confirms the loss.

Having worked as a journalist a few years ago (no longer, thank god), it is entirely possible for a professional journalist to pump out an article in 20 mins. You have to realize that CNBC most likely has a team of researchers and writers and editors on JUST the GME stuff. They have TEAMS of people whose job for the past couple of months would have been to keep an eye on this stock. They most likely had statistics and quotes ready to publish. Note how the quotes are from their own airtime, it‚Äôs not like they had to call up someone and get a quote (which isn‚Äôt that impossible to do within 20 mins either)

1482,GME," My hypothesis:

First gamma squeeze driven heavily by retail action and unexpected.  A lot of retail went in and held.  

This time around, the action is from the institutions.  Retail already has a lot of capital locked up in GME. You can see the price increases are controlled to prevent halts.  My guess is that there is an institutional battle right now.  Some are trying to bring the price down, others are steadily bringing the price up.

The January gamma was unexpected.  This time, both sides are prepared and have a gameplan.  That's why we see this steady climb.  This steady climb is taking us towards the precipice without the halts.  Once at the precipice, all bets are off and no one can predict exactly how it will unfold because of retail's volatility.",c-digs,12,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1p4up/a_refresher_on_what_the_is_going_on_with_gme/gqfr5hn/,0.036,0.942,0.022,-0.4215

1564,AMC," My explanation for why there was such a large dip:

Volume was WAY too low to cause such a huge drop in price, so I asked in GME Megathread Part 1, ""How could that large of a dip happen, with such a low volume?"", also pointing out that IBorrowDesk didn't report any new shorts, during the time of the dip. I didn't realize that when shorts are borrowed, the borrower has 3 days to use them, or they have to be returned. Shorts HAVE been borrowed, in large numbers, over the past few days. That means that hedgies were borrowing shorted shares, iron handing them, borrowing more, and then they released them all at once (or in large chunks because of the halts). That allowed them to tank the price in a very direct and focused manner, say $160 in a matter of 20 minutes (and that includes the halt times). I believe this was an attempt to trigger stop losses and scare day-traders into selling. The immediate rebound and the fact that THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED TO AMC, AT THE SAME TIME, seems to corroborate this theory.

Thanks to /u/_Exordium
, for explaining this rule for borrowing shorts!

220@$125.61 average

TLDR: Since there has been millions of shares shorted over the past few days, and they have 3 days to use the shorted shares, I think that the dip was caused by hedgies hoarding shorts to release all at once. Thus tanking the price and triggering stop losses and scaring day-traders into paperhanding.

1566,GME," My explanation for why there was such a large dip:

Volume was WAY too low to cause such a huge drop in price, so I asked in GME Megathread Part 1, ""How could that large of a dip happen, with such a low volume?"", also pointing out that IBorrowDesk didn't report any new shorts, during the time of the dip. I didn't realize that when shorts are borrowed, the borrower has 3 days to use them, or they have to be returned. Shorts HAVE been borrowed, in large numbers, over the past few days. That means that hedgies were borrowing shorted shares, iron handing them, borrowing more, and then they released them all at once (or in large chunks because of the halts). That allowed them to tank the price in a very direct and focused manner, say $160 in a matter of 20 minutes (and that includes the halt times). I believe this was an attempt to trigger stop losses and scare day-traders into selling. The immediate rebound and the fact that THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED TO AMC, AT THE SAME TIME, seems to corroborate this theory.

Thanks to /u/_Exordium
, for explaining this rule for borrowing shorts!

1575,DD," # People. Literally fucking chill with the FUD.

We're still up on the day, and we're up almost 110% this week. The rise has been pretty steady, and you have to keep in mind that they borrowed an absolute shit ton of shares today. They don't have to immediately short their shares once they borrow them, so they can build up their supply in order to hit us with huge price drops when the price goes too high for their comfort.

The price was rising very rapidly today, up to around $350, and they decided to pull out all the stops and stifle what they could, but the massive amount of buy-ins on the dip put the price back above where we left off yesterday and up 8% from where today started. If you zoom the chart out, it looks like a staircase. Huge spike, light cooldown followed by sideways trading, then repeat. This is bullish as fuck, and today was the first time we broke that cycle to this extent. As far as I'm concerned, we're doing great.

All these FUD comments are honestly pretty sad, and the real ones here know what's up.

Not financial advice, but stop whining and look at the past few days, then *try* to tell me it's over.

Also, FUD stands for Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt.

50,000 shorts were pulled out then put back in, probably what drove the price down before ending at 265.

What will the SHITers do tomorrow with only 150,000 shorta available? Honestly, I have no idea.

1598,GME," Remember! Even on SSR they can short the stock on an uptick! 

Usually you can short a stock at any time you want. GME dropped more than 10% at some point today so it has been placed on SSR (Short Sale Restriction) 

This means that if the price is already going down, you are not allowed to short it. However, if the price is going up, you are allowed to.

My thoughts on this is that lunchtime today was a tester. If they‚Äôre sat on the shorts that have gone from iBorrowDesk, then tomorrow they may try to drive the price down every time it starts going up. They may still have a lot of ammo left. 

Now if every time the price goes up it starts to tank immediately afterwards, that could cause people to panic and think everyone is selling off their stock which would then cause people to sell. 

If I was trying to drive the price down, I would short just enough to drop it each time it goes up and then wait to see if that was enough, if not, throw more at it the next time it goes up.

It seemed like the only way to ensure they win and retail investors lose by making us the bag holders once they hit their break-even point and crash the stock.

It's also clear that in today's desperation, there was an abject failure. The $350 gain was essentially wiped away, but all that does is delay us a day. If they had ammo to run the stock down, why not do it when it's trading at $50, when sentiment was low, when smart larger investors can't see how this thing just prints money?

**What does ""fee"" rate mean?**
*A stock loan fee is the fee charged by a brokerage for borrowing shares. In iborrowdesk.com's case, the fee rate is expressed as an annualized percentage charged by Interactive Brokers.*

More info: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-loan-fee.asp
________________________________________________________
**What does ""available"" mean?**
*In order to borrow shares from a brokerage (iborrowdesk.com monitors Interactive Brokers), that brokerage needs shares available to lend out. Typically these belong to other clients of the firm, or they could belong to Interactive Brokers itself. Liquid large cap securities are typically ""easy"" to borrow. That is, brokerages have plenty of clients willing to lend out their shares. Some securities are in high demand - many people want to borrow them, or some may have restricted supply - few people willing to lend them. In either case the ""available"" number can be low*

1936,AMC," I'm not invested in AMC, but I appreciate the effort in keeping the stock up and keeping them alive.

One thing that AMC has done incredibly well is see the writing on the wall, and realize that going to movies for people needs to be an ""experience"" now. They have a difficult time competing with the at-home market, and I think they realized that. So they've transformed many of their locations by including the reclining seating, bars, and other things. I really do hope they are able to continue the transformation so that the theater becomes a center for the community to gather and have that experience.

A great example of this is the Emagine theater close to me. Not only do they have the same seating and bar, but they have a sit down eatery and a bowling alley.

I remember seeing it only really related to TSLA before the whole GME ordeal. 

AMC/BB were never short plays, they were just people who FOMO‚Äôd after GME skyrocketed and wanted to look for the ‚Äúnext GME‚Äù without analyzing the underlying fundamentals of the situation.  Wild price fluctuations in both were simply due to retail investors frenzy. 

I‚Äôm long BB and while I find it interesting AMC was able to stave off bankruptcy due to retail investors, I don‚Äôt see squeezing or being a good long term investment. The price could fluctuate wildly over the next few months but it will have nothing to do with a short squeeze.",FrgElder,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1oho6/everything_isnt_a_short_squeeze/gqfxwcl/,0.034,0.898,0.068,0.523

Congratulations, truly, for your financial success but also realize that your parents are a massive contributing factor to your financial beginnings here.

My parents didn't have an extra car to buy when I was 19. I walked to and from school, and work. 4am Costco job meant leaving the house at 2am to get there in time. I think I made... $9? Maybe $10 an hour? It was crazy good for that time (2006) considering my previous call center job that had just come to town was considered ""good money"" for paying $8.25. My job just before that was at a movie theater making the federal minimum wage $5.15 but I was there when it hiked up to $7.25. I didn't have a car, lived with my brother and my girlfriend and paid $325/month for rent, had to buy my own food (yummy Kroger-brand microwave pizzas 10 for $0.10!), water, electricity, internet. I owned nothing I didn't buy myself.

Not telling a sob story or anything, but you should know that your folks are (in this one regard) AMAZING people. My friend's parents kicked them all out on their 18th birthday. They came to school on the bus carrying everything they had on them and had to rotate crashing on friends' couches until they could get enough of us together to get a place which wasn't easy because renters saw a bunch of roudy teenagers with crummy jobs and the better places simply didn't want to risk us skipping rent or being a pain.

If you make a bunch of money on GME, or anything in your life, please thank your parents very much and appreciate whatever it was in their lives that allowed them to also be able to provide for you as well. Give them a hug, tell them you love them very much and cherish the time you'll get to spend with them as someone financially independent. **Edit after your reply** Or fuck all that and get revenge by having a life well lived.",MontyAtWork,14,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1mo2l/as_a_19yo_college_student_this_money_is/gqejict/,0.053,0.789,0.158,0.9915

2133,REAL," I'm a 'Boomer'. I have invested all of my adult life.  I've seen some shit.  I've watched hedge funds destroy businesses to enrich themselves and their clients.  Good businesses built by hard working people.  Hedge funds are parasites.  They conspire.  They pick targets.  People lose jobs and homes.  
I understand the enormity of the situation that is unfolding.  I understand this will only happen once on this scale.  It most likely won't happen again because hedge funds won't be this stupid in the future.  This time they are going to get arms and legs cut off.  This is my one opportunity to enrich myself.  I have waited years to find myself in this position.   The hedge funds broke laws by naked shorting and that's why they are in a corner now.   The managers are facing federal prison.  They are looking at losing their licenses.   I now have the power to completely dis-assemble their lives like they have done to others for so long.   They have to come through me to buy REAL SHARES to cover the fake ones they made up.   I am going to set the price of a share by HOLDING.  If you think $300,000 per share is unreasonable then put yourself in their shoes.  What would you pay to stay out of jail, keep your toys, licenses, club memberships, keep your kids in private school,  maintain your status in the community, keep your seats on various prestigous boards, your 3 big homes, your vacations to Europe twice a year on private jet?????????

2174,GME," Also bear in mind that at peak, there'll be a major sell off. That will drop the price from the top to probably something fractional of its original. This will trigger a second round of buy offs, aka a dead cat bounce driving the price back up to fractional positive values (if the peak reaches several thousand a share), and that'll lead to a second fall off until the price stabilises to , 230-385 range.

I fully expect there to be two major money making opportunities with GME. The primary will for most lead to a 10-100-1000-10000x ROI, and the secondary will for most lead to a 3/5-30/50-300/500x ROI (this is a guess and subjective to however much each individual invests).

This is just napkin math and there's no real formula to the peak of a dead cat bounce, but dcbs and bull traps according to google are the same thing. DCBs also tend to occur the most during a short squeeze. We saw that happen with GME where it went to 347, dipped hard to 193 and then went back to 345 before declining down to ~40.

DCBs can happen multiple times per stock cycle as well. The higher the value the more bounces are possible. So if GME goes to Mars at 3,000/share theoretically, then it's entirely possible that a correction down to 1k could lead to a bounce back to 2k, then another correction down to 500 will bounce back to 1k, and then finally stabilize with ups and downs between 230-385.


Understand that the above is just an example. It's not real, and no one knows how high GME will go. More importantly, it cannot be stressed enough that DCBs though have the potential to make a bit more money along the way down, are very risky plays because there's no formula to how high those bounce peaks are. You could theoretically reinvest half your GME earnings expecting a significant gain only for it to within hours net you 10% before cratering 30% leading you to lose more than you gained.

Understand your own risk tolerance and trade responsibly.

---

All that said though, when GME gets to the top (whatever that is), if the 230-385 range is actually true for a fair value price, then puts against GME will be money making opportunities; though... the premiums on puts for GME out to anywhere from end of this month to Oct 15 are insane. ~110-115/share premium is insane. A single 420 put out to 10/15 is $28.8k.

Remember that puts can be used to acquire GME shares for a lower cost. The only risk is that you lose the premium when you exercise; which at 28.8k is ridiculous even if the potential profit value of that curve is multiple times that.

2190,GME," I was primarily referring to gross margin, but this does bring up a couple more points to make.

My original point was that the gross margin on pet supplies is in the 60-70% range.  The gross margin for computers / computer equipment is in the ~30-40% range.  

All other things being equal, this gives Chewy a higher future net.

Now, all other things are definitely not equal.  A major factor is the fact that GME has ~5,500 physical stores.  Each store has operational expenses (lease, utilities, etc.)  Chewy.com doesn't have that. 

The 64K question would be whether they can find a way to drive additional revenue at the physical locations that you **COULD NOT** simply do via on-line.   I'd say that currently the answer is **NO**.

The future case about converting them into in-person gaming havens is compelling; however, I've never been in a GameStop that would be large enough to have the floor space for this.  This would require **NEW** locations and additional capital outlay to build this out, etc.",beyerch,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1qhjn/why_gamestop_is_still_undervalued_today/gqfdvlu/,0.058,0.892,0.05,-0.3612

2193,GME," They are really not comparable though. The problem with GameStop although switching to an online e-commerce model, they still can‚Äôt offer digital buying and downloading. They still are only selling the physical copy of a game. They also aren‚Äôt just competing with Steam on this, that‚Äôs just PC sales and GameStop doesn‚Äôt even really have a market there unless they sell pc parts or something. Their real competition is with Microsoft and Sony, which ironically they already rely on to survive as a business. As these Xbox‚Äôs and PlayStation‚Äôs keep getting more and more storage(which they did with the new gen) the need for physical copies of games is going to almost entirely fizzle out. Microsoft and Sony already have marketplaces on the system to buy and download games just through the system. Long story short, I‚Äôm not bullish at all long term on GME.

2245,BAM," Nah I don't buy this. Something really isn't right, i'll explain why.


So today I thought it would be fun to watch the price on my Trading 21w app while I was working.

I saw it go up to $340 when I then noticed that the price froze at $340.08 for 15 minutes - it didn't move up or two a single cent.

I thought ""what the fuck? No way, are they manipulating this again!?"" when I fucking shit you not, Trading 212 sends me a push notification saying ""GME rallies to $330"".

Looking at my screen I thought, but it's at $340.08?

Then BAM, it must've been 5 seconds after that push notification, the prices BOMBS straight down to $190 triggering my buy limit. This buy limit should NOT have triggered as the app clearly stated that trading was halted as NYSE had halted trading.

I have about $500 left in my account for buying. So, when this started going back up, i've just tried to put a buy limit - 2 for $190 - it won't let me. It says I do not have enough funds to cover 2 stocks @$190 - that's $380 - so I have another $120 in my account.

I can however place a buy order for 1 stock @$190.

But then when I try and place a second buy order for $190, it says I do not have enough funds.

I honestly think this is more to do with market makers and the apps not having enough actualy stock of GME, and kot enough liquidity and cash to pay out sells.",TimsKillerRabbit,67,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m24gn6/gme_trading_halted_7_times_this_past_hour/gqhaog6/,0.043,0.906,0.051,0.7215

2281,RH," The current situation is a bit different to the first time, I don't think they have a leg to stand on to halt buys like they did in january.
Volume was 150mil+ a day at the height of the run and social media was overrun with gamestop headlines which was bringing more fuel to the fire. They could logically justify the halt then by throwing vlad & RH under the bus but not this time. This time it's a slower, steadier & less volatile burn and will be extremely hard for brokers to justify halting trades on a stock that is trading at 30-50 m volume a day and not being talked about massively in the media or online. 
That being said, it's not guaranteed, I could be wrong. We all just have to wait and see.

Edit: Jinxed it lol, volume doesn't add up for  this big of a price drop. They're swinging back hard now, it's heating up üî•",shadyxstep,61,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m20o5c/dfv_predicts_that_the_price_of_gme_will_reach_10k/gqgr894/,0.079,0.887,0.034,-0.7294

2285,GME," Fidelity and Schwab don't use Apex Clearing. During the last gamme squeeze in Jan they didn't restrict buy orders because they have their own clearing houses.  


Meanwhile Fidelity owns vast stakes in GME, so does Schwab, so it's in their best interest to let people buy buy buy, and their cash reserves are gigantic - and it's like handing money to themselves. They can't pull out their stock, but having it skyrocket will pay them out come earning time.  


They snaked my mom a buy order at $170 during this plunge, they've likely got their best people and computers automating trades hardcore.  


Apex Clearing is the root of most of this evil, but they don't use them. There's a good post about this somewhere about which places continued to allow buyers during the halts, and those two were up there. I know.  


I changed my accounts specifically for this, so I could execute limit-buys on the dips, and it's worked twice for me.
