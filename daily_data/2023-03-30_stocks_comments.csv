9,EA," That's the interesting thing about EA, despite the generally anti-consumer capitalization methods applied in their games; they're overall, one of the better companies in the industry in terms of internal policy and worker treatment.

At the very least, they're way better than the daily worker harassment controversy companies like Riot and Blizzard.

-----

It's also worth noting that they'll often go to bat in support of games having development issues:

* People often attribute Titanfall 2's failure to EA, but it was Respawn's leadership who insisted that the game launch in direct competition to the launch window of CoD: Infinite Warfare and Battlefield 1.

* Bioware spent 5-ish years workshopping ideas and features for Anthem, but they never had a concrete idea of what they wanted the game to be, in fact for most of that pre-development, there was never even an elevator pitch for the game; the E3 announcement for Anthem was basically the concept for the game. Even then Anthem's development was complete development hell. It's been reported that managers would go into meetings to make development-critical decisions, argue for the entire day, and then end the meeting with no decisions being made and thus leaving the actual dev team members with nothing to work on. EA recognised this and tried to send advisors, hardware, and other resources to pull Anthem out of development hell and those same Bioware managers were the ones who stone walled EA at every attempt to help.

Also, as we've seen from the Dead Space remake, EA is also fully capable of learning from their mistakes (particularly with DS3 which I personally half blame on EA and half blame on the general state of 360/PS3 era game trends).",mythrilcrafter,5,/r/stocks/comments/1260zr0/electronic_arts_is_cutting_about_800_jobs_or_6_of/je9r3w7/,0.145,0.8,0.056,-0.987

16,EA," Yeah except EA *has* made NBA games in the last 10 years. The last game was Live 2019. And it stunk so they stopped releasing new ones. This actually adds to the point I was making. 

I say they haven’t released a good NFL game or NBA game in 10 years - in addition to the parent comment about NHL - and your take is “well that’s only because they don’t make NBA games anymore.” That’s either a strawman argument or you’re missing the entire point.

And FWIW, from what I’ve read, rumors are that EA hasn’t released a new version of Live recently because what they’ve worked on is still not up to snuff and they don’t want to reintroduce their NBA line against the 2K series with a sub-par game, but they still do plan to get back into the NBA gaming pool eventually.

40,IMO," A lot of these stocks never any sense to me from an investor's perspective, and I'm saying this as someone who knows the EV industry well.

* Lordstown - I have no idea why this stock ever appealed to anyone. I never even heard anyone hyped up for any of their vehicles. I doubt anyone but the most hardcore EV enthusiasts could even name one of their EV models that they've announced.

* Lucid - At least it had promise with it's vehicle. But the problem is it simply entered the market too late and only sells very high end luxury vehicles. Also the Saudi backers are undermining the stock by forcing them to build a factory in Saudi Arabia, a country that's a good distance away from all 3 of the largest car markets (China, the US, & Europe) and where there's very little demand for EV's.

* Nikola - The thing was clearly a scam from a mile away. And Hydrogen powered vehicles are NOT EV's, it doesn't matter to the consumer if the hydrogen is turned into electricity to run the car when there's no hydrogen refueling stations near them. IMO it's flat out false advertising to claim that Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are EVs given that it can confuse consumers.

* Nio - Their battery swap stations make no sense. Tesla explored this many years ago in their early days but ditched it for good reason, it's way more expensive to scale then building out an EV charging infrastructure. And Battery-As-A-Service is a terrible idea to, which is why no one else has adopted the strategy. If it weren't for them pursuing these bad strategies then Nio would be a lot more viable IMO.

* Rivian - This company simply moves WAY too slow to be successful. It took them 12 years to bring a single vehicle to market. 

Bottom line, if you want to invest in EV's just buy Tesla stock, it'll be a lot safer then any of these other EV stocks the OP mentions (given that they're sitting on a ton of cash and are making a profit, unlike the rest of these money losing EV stocks, most of which will probably go bankrupt sooner or later).",ShadowLiberal,38,/r/stocks/comments/12660rm/2_year_update_to_this_ev_sector/je8e8oc/,0.115,0.802,0.083,-0.8896

It's an intriguing idea for the Chinese market that 1) it entices people to buy the model since the upfront cost on the car is lower since they aren't buying the battery 2) generates subscription revenue streams.

131,GOOGL," Well reddit is mainly about people ""reinforcement seeking"".

They already have an opinion on a stock such as GOOGL is great value, then seek reinforcement from others that it is true.

I find people here judge stocks based on recent figures.

It's like catching a ball based on where the ball currently is in the air, rather than (correctly) catching a ball based on where it will land.

When a ball is barely moving, then that works fine. Would work for stocks like KO.

But when the ball is in the middle of a tornado, who knows where it will land? Like TSLA a couple of years ago. Yet people act like the ball in the tornado is stationary (hope that makes sense). 

Why the above analogy?

Because if you want to discuss a stock that's currently in the tornado, you won't get good responses.

It's unfortunate that people didn't learn from TSLA. People were convinced it was the biggest bubble in history because at the end of 2020 when TSLA had a PE of 1000.

Despite only dropping 17% since then, the PE dropped to 50s because income went from 690mil to 12580 mil.

That should have been eye-opening that the market was highly accurate in pricing TSLA's future of massive net income growth and not simply irrational retail cult investors.",wearahat03,6,/r/stocks/comments/126hopo/rstocks_daily_discussion_options_trading_thursday/je9ozrd/,0.03,0.841,0.129,0.9539

169,AI," Out of all the tech companies, google is positioned perfectly to keep pulling in revenue via its paid ads and other sources, while staying innovative. I don't see it taking a nosedive. It's going to either remain stagnant or gradually increase. I can foresee it increasing. Not to mention with AI getting even better, it can target ads better. As boomers get older and fade out, internet ads will increase and AI will play its role in targeting those ads. 

The ads are just one part of it, of course, they do a lot of other stuff as well. It is the wisest play to invest in google and hold over the next 30 years.

170,PR," 100% agreed, it was definitely a PR move to quickly take the heat off what he was saying at the time and they wanted to axe relations to further themselves from him. Adidas do decently in Europe and Asia but in North America it’s always been a mixed bag and none of the collaborators they have is on the same level as the Yeezy brand (RIP to the Beyonce line). 

The issue from a consumer perspective is that Adidas shoe models are boring compared to say a Nike and they don’t have as much brand presence compared to Nike as well. The Yeezy brand was helping Adidas bridge the gap and have a line that appealed to a great amount of consumers and offer fresh designs to them.
