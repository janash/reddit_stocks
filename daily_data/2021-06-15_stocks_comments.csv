&#x200B;

From report:

The company went public in a 3-way merger between (1) DraftKings, (2) its SPAC sponsor, and (3) a Bulgaria-based gaming technology company called SBTech.  
SBTech accounted for \~25% of total revenue at the SPAC consummation and was the only positive contributor to operating income, providing both financial stability and technology to the deal.  
Unbeknownst to investors, DraftKings‚Äô merger with SBTech also brings exposure to extensive dealings in black-market gaming, money laundering and organized crime.  
Based on conversations with multiple former employees, a review of SEC & international filings, and inspection of back-end infrastructure at illicit international gaming websites, we show that SBTech has a long and ongoing record of operating in black markets.  
We estimate that roughly 50% of SBTech‚Äôs revenue continues to come from markets where gambling is banned, based on an analysis of DraftKings‚Äô SEC filings, conversations with former employees, and supporting documents.  
As one former employee told us, DraftKings‚Äô subsidiary SBTech has ""sold to plenty of mobs"", a sharp contrast to the clean image of DraftKings‚Äô brand-conscious partners, including the NFL, NBA, NASCAR, UFC and PGA, and the company‚Äôs recent hire of supermodel Gisele Bundchen to advise on governance issues.  
Prior to the SPAC merger, SBTech seems to have made a concerted effort to distance itself from its black-market dealings. Illicit customer relationships were shuffled into a newly formed ‚Äúdistributor‚Äù entity called BTi/CoreTech, with \~50 SBTech employees shifted across town to the new entity.  
The CEO selected to run BTi/CoreTech was formerly an executive of a 'binary options' gambling firm raided by the FBI and subsequently charged by the SEC for deceiving U.S. investors out of over $100 million.  
Former SBTech employees called BTi/CoreTech a ‚Äúfront‚Äù, and said the split preserved SBTech‚Äôs (and now DraftKings‚Äô) illicit business while shielding the public company from scrutiny. For all practical purposes, it appears that BTi/CoreTech functions as DraftKings‚Äô undisclosed illegal gaming division.  
We identified numerous black market clients of DraftKings‚Äô ‚Äúfront‚Äù entity, through searches on social media and back-end web infrastructure. For example, an Asia-focused site tied to a triad kingpin at the center of a Swiss money laundering investigation advertises its use of BTi/CoreTech technology.  
In 2019, Vietnamese authorities arrested 22 individuals involved in a ‚Äúmassive illegal online sports betting ring"" linked to BTi/CoreTech's platform.  
Contrary to representations made to Oregon‚Äôs state lottery, a former employee told us SBTech had extensive operations in Iran, violating local laws in a market subject to heavy U.S. sanctions. We were told SBTech knowingly operated there for 4-5 years with the founder directly overseeing the operation.  
Around the time of the DraftKings deal, SBTech‚Äôs founder spun off another gaming entity that also operated in markets where gambling was banned, transferring it to his brother. The brand was behind a ‚Äúmassive Chinese operation‚Äù, according to a former employee, contrary to representations made to Oregon‚Äôs state lottery.  
The brand continues to operate in China despite the strict local rules prohibiting online gambling, according to our review of web infrastructure for multiple China-facing gambling sites. DraftKings continues to transact with the entity, according to SEC filings.  
DraftKings trades at a \~26x last twelve months (LTM) sales multiple and a \~20x estimated 2021 sales multiple despite (i) no expectation of earnings for years, (ii) intense competition, and (iii) regulatory risk. The company posted net losses of $844 million in 2020 and $346 million last quarter.  
Insiders have dumped over $1.4 billion in stock since the company went public a little over a year ago, with SBTech‚Äôs founder leading the pack, having personally sold \~$568 million in shares.  
Despite a rocky track record prior to taking DraftKings public, the company‚Äôs SPAC sponsors ultimately received 9.3 million shares, worth around $114 million at the time, in exchange for a token $25 thousand contribution.",Swingtrader79,5,/r/stocks/comments/o0e4b4/dkng_down_10/h1ukrpl/,0.056,0.916,0.028,-0.9596

61,GME," I'm pretty sure the number is actually higher than 80-90%, I remember anything of 92-98% depending on the year.

If you draw a scale of risk from 1 to 10, where would YOU put normal stocks? Stocks is a difficult term because it includes those at the top (usually value but not always), the growth stocks and let's just call the rest small cap. It's not accurate but close enough to be used.

Technically speaking the market works against you if you do what most people do and work in percentages. Let's say you make a 50% gain and a 50% loss repeatedly - or in other words you just flip a coin. It might seem like investing into stocks is more favorable than that, but considering you might have the lowest valued stock compared to company performance and no one buys it, that's just how the market is. It's people buying and selling, not an algorithm working and rewarding good research.

So with the 50% up and down

100, 150, 75, 112, 56, 84, 42, 63, 32, 48, 24, 36, 18, 27...

I think you get the point. Of course + and - 50% does not have the same value, but if you trade on the market you might see either quite frequently. And our brains work in 2 major ways regarding profits: take them way too early or way too late. This means you heavily miss out on when you should actually take them. This is easily said because who knows how long it goes up, but for a rough rule set a goal before investing and instantly sell there. Rarely change this. Most people just buy and then see what happens to decide what happens.

Same with losses. Mentality is also the same, either they sell way too quickly at a minor loss or they get too attached and see it come crash down. While this is easily a 90% for penny stocks, for larger companies that can be a 20-30% drop and it might take years to recover.

CFD is a beautiful verification of this behavior. 74-86% of all investors lose their money. Here in Europe they need a legal warning for this. This shows how much gambling is included in the nature of trading for most people. While CFD have interest included, that's not how people LOSE their money, they overgamble leverage because they again fail to see when they should sell or stop to buy.

Take the meme stocks for example. Someone wrote a comment on how people that think it crashes down should just short it and put money to their word. I said this is flawed logic to think like that, the risk is simply not worth it. It should be obvious that they are way beyond a proper evaluation right now and market history shows this will correct eventually. But no one knows when. If you shorted GME at 200$ then good luck, it went up to 350-500$ depending on your exchange (US I think it was 350, at German exchange it hit 500 and after crashed down). This means you face a ton of risk depending on how long it rallies up, and it crashing down to close to 30$ won't help you if you got margin called previously on its way up. But the person shows his mindset and lack of knowledge on trading - and how easily people lose money or fail to beat the market.",oodex,4,/r/stocks/comments/o02l3y/if_index_funds_outperform_regular_investors_8090/h1trf1h/,0.105,0.78,0.115,0.8634

Each layer added introduces unseen risks in ANY complex system and those build over time.  Index funds really haven't been around that long and I'd argue that we have yet to see what their true risks really are.  While statistically nobody can ""beat"" the market as an individual, the whole system is predicated on the assumption that everyone is TRYING to do that.  When a majority is NOT trying to do that, the risks change. If we are still using the old risk model on top of the new paradigm then it seems we are in for a ride.  This is how black swan events are introduced into a system.... If every thing is priced on the assumption that it's a normal bell curve (Brownian motion with every body acting independently), when in fact it's a fat tailed curve (indexing and options) then the models will not be able to price in the correct risk.

78,NAV," This is a ridiculous sentiment. The market is an enclosed system. For every winner there is a loser. By design, some investors do better than others. If an index fund rises then it‚Äôs NAV rises which means any individuals who invested in the top 50% of that funds companies outperform the index. It‚Äôs not that almost no one outperforms funds. Is that almost no one has the patience to sit and hold their individual investments. This is not an ability issue it is a behavioral issue. 

A study of Fidelity brokerage accounts shows that its top performing clients were those that died and didn‚Äôt have their accounts closed for one reason or another. Second best performance was those that forgot their password. Nothing to do with funds, just patience. People are plenty capable of picking winners. Tesla alone has me so far ahead of market gains that I would need to lose money for years for index funds to catch me from a percentage gain perspective. Before that it was Disney and before that it was Exxon. Diversification is for people that don‚Äôt understand what they want to invest in. Pick 5 Solid companies and ride them through their peaks. You will outperform the market easily.

Problem with shorting is you don't know when it's gonna fall. it's not like going long, where you can just wait forever for it to go up. Short is essentially a time-limited leveraged investment because you need to borrow that stock and short it by a certain time. And I'm pretty sure retail investors can't naked short. On top of that you are exposed to infinite risk, because the price can go up to infinity. 

If you think the price will fall, you can buy put options. But even then you still need to know when and how far you think the price will fall.

119,NFLX," I dont own any NFLX

Here is my opinion. Its probably time to put to rest the idea that any platform will dominate. It wont. I think we need to start talking about them like they are ""tv channels"" not like ""cable providers.""

Think back to the days when we had only 10-20 channels on tv. Later, we had 200-300. Did the new channels hurt the old ones? The answer is, not really. What hurt them was their own programming, not someone elses.

The other providers wont slow them because none of them will provide enough new content on their own to keep people satisfied regardless. I mean seriously... even if Netflix suddenly had 10 big hit shows, that barely 120-200 hours a year of content. Pretty sure people spend more than 2-4 hours a week on tv... they will need more than 1 content provider and who has 10 shows worth watching? LoL.

So forget competition.

Does Netflix have enough exclusive content to hold and gain new customers at $9-$14/mo? I would say yes. For me its Witcher, Umbrella Academy and Stranger Things.

Is their stock priced high? Well I dont own any for a reason...

yea I think its a bit too high because I am not really sure how many more subs hey can actually get. So given their high PE, I dont want to be stuck with a company that may very well hit their cap in a 2-3 years. The PE will likely still be 30 or so on current basis so to me, thats not so great. They will need to start raising prices to keep the rev growth going up which is fine but it will likely decay to 15 PE pretty quickly from there. Pass for now. Id rather hold Amazon because they have more avenues of growth as crazy as that sounds. Then again, maybe sub growth will be much higher than that. Maybe they can get into China or maybe India skyrockets. Dunno. They might have capped the USA and other English speaking nations but no idea about the others.",thejumpingsheep2,1,/r/stocks/comments/o00pa3/does_netflix_feel_like_a_ticking_time_bomb_to/h1tisbx/,0.059,0.832,0.109,0.9206

121,AMC," Netflix has significant advantages in software, international growth and support, and custom content. While other companies have been sleeping and sticking to old models, Netflix steadily grew its own content farm and became a big player in custom content, paying new and buzzing creators big payouts and building a reputation of creative freedom and quality similar to what HBO and AMC networks were able to build. In addition, Netflix has really found out the international game, creating quality custom content for other countries. The custom new content will only grow, with hits such as Stranger Things, Queen's Gambit, Tiger King, and Bridgerton. 

Netflix also has superior data tracking, allowing them to find out exactly what you like and gear content creation where the audience is better than any competition other than maybe Disney. Disney is limited by its brand however, and can't stray too far from the Disney principles, similar to how Nintendo can't stray too far from their style of content.   


Netflix is still the leader with over 200 million subscribers, Disney with over 100 million and HBO and Huly with only about 40 million. Other services straggle with far less than 40 million subscribers. Killer content like The Office isn't enough to combat this. By being an early player, with superior tech, Netflix is poised to be a market leader for years to come. In addition, other companies will find the costs of getting into the battle too high and they may fold. In order to compete with the established players, they have to offer a competing price point, which means they have a higher price for content per subscriber.   


I believe Netflix will continue to be able to produce content that can capture audiences, while the other companies to compete will have deep pockets like Amazon, Disney and Apple, and we may see some companies give up and realize licensing their content is the way to go to be profitable, instead of having to get into the business of technology which is an expensive business to run. Also, it's been shown that users have a higher threshold of acceptance for being subscribed to multiple services. Most people will probably have a combination of Netflix, Hulu, HBO and Disney and find this totally acceptable. I feel that shorting Netflix would be a foolish thing to do, as they are still in a long term trend of adding subscribers and while the trend is slowing, they show no signs of declining, even with competition.

Their deliberately opaque subscriber metrics.  Loss of crucially attractive content.  Their crazily irresponsible studio operation.  Their (probable) saturation in certain markets.  Their lack of ability to compete in the content spending arms race that they caused.  That they won't reveal how many subs are paying $15 and how many are paying $2.  The fact their many competitors (Apple, Disney, Facebook, Amazon, Google) can afford to burn money for decades longer than Netflix can.

Not true. There are still companies that will license out content to whoever bids on them and don't have a streaming service. Even the companies that have streaming services will still license out content to Netflix. In fact, they will still even make shows for Netflix. In TV there's a a long history of companies making shows for other channels they don't own and that probably won't change any time soon. 

Amazon has a lot of cash, but it doesn't mean that they are going to consistently spend it all on Amazon Prime video. They have other endeavors too and companies like to hold on to cash. 


> And now that everyone has a streaming service, Netflix is losing a lot of their shows it feels. They've lost their most popular one to Peacock, and their own originals don't seem to be blowing up consistently like they did in the Stranger Things era when they had The Office along with many other shows.

Netflix is losing a lot of old shows that are popular but thy also replace them with other llicensed popular shows. But on top of that they are making lots of new shows. Netflix shows do not to blow up like stranger things in order to bring values to consumers. Netflix doesn't make more money by having the most watched shows. They make money by continuing to add value that people stay subscribed. And Netflix still makes popular content that trends or gets critical acclaim at least every months. But again that doesn't matter as long as you have people watching something. Whether it's all one show or spread across multiple shows; what matters is that they are subscribed.

157,TV," >they mine user data like crazy unlike the disconnect sordid mess that Network research did to find out what people like.

This is the often forgotten golden goose of Netflix. 

When it comes to buying, developing, and presenting original content to users, Netflix can dig into a very robust and granular data set that gives them an intimate view of what their users enjoy watching. The mainstream networks and studios don‚Äôt have access to that kind of information. The best they have are focus groups, which provide only a handful of very broad metrics, are rather expensive, and not guaranteed to be accurate. Compare that to Netflix, which collects data in real time and in about the most natural way possible with little added cost, and there‚Äôs simply no competition. 

That said, saturation of the streaming market does pose a problem for Netflix. With the way things are going, it‚Äôs easy to see a future where every major network has their own streaming service and keeps its content exclusive. Popular content from mainstream networks is a big draw for Netflix. It may prove rather difficult - not to mention expensive - to produce enough content, for enough people, with great enough frequency to keep the volume of paying customers that they currently have. That‚Äôs not to say that Netflix is doomed, but it certainly puts a squeeze on their potential growth. 

That said, I can see a few available avenues that Netflix can take to compensate for that squeeze. Number one is advertising. It‚Äôs practically non-existent in Netflix‚Äôs current business model and the aforementioned wealth of data they possess would allow them to charge a premium for highly targeted ad-space. How that could be implemented is another question. I think the most obvious way would be to create an additional discounted service teir that includes advertising, similar to how Hulu operates. Another potential area of growth is live TV. Given Netflix‚Äôs popularity with cord cutters, it seems only natural that they take further advantage of that and get into streaming live TV from mainstream networks. This presents not only an added revenue stream from subscription fees, but also the opportunity to sell better and more targeted advertising in a context where consumers already expect to see ads. Further down the road, given entry into live TV, there is also the opportunity for Netflix to partner more closely with the mainstream networks on advertising where they, with all their user data, could act as a sort of broker for live TV ad buys. These closer relationships could also present an avenue for Netflix to better maintain its stock of 3rd party content. 

One glaringly big problem with all of this: Netflix, in its own words, doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with it. Going so far as to compare themselves to HBO, they‚Äôve stated clearly that they want content creation to be the driving force behind their business. With HBO being a privately held business, it‚Äôs hard to draw comparisons due to a lack of data, but with Netflix having over $25 billion in revenue and HBO having only a fraction of that, it‚Äôs a bit unsettling to see Netflix point to them as being an apt comparison for their business model. 

Long story short, I think Netflix‚Äôs content creation is great, but it can‚Äôt be the only thing that sustains them, not with their access to 3rd party content from mainstream networks dwindling. If they try to do that, then they‚Äôll eventually just be another studio pumping out content. That scenario represents a contraction of their business, not growth. There are still plenty of opportunities for Netflix to take advantage of, it‚Äôs just a matter of wether or not they do.",Aspirin_Dispenser,1,/r/stocks/comments/o00pa3/does_netflix_feel_like_a_ticking_time_bomb_to/h1uebiz/,0.031,0.816,0.153,0.9975

160,IP," It‚Äôs a good theory, in practice it isn‚Äôt true.

The biggest issue in the space isn‚Äôt users that cycle through streaming platforms trying to find good shows. It‚Äôs that the cost of the content is absurdly high to either maintain a license or develop original content.

They address that with: more users, higher prices, cutting down on shared accounts, and lowering production costs and writing longer deals for established content.

Your question is imagining utopic version of streaming that transcended licenses: unified all content to a singular platform, unlimited DVR capacity (playback), available for a rate of $8 a month with practically unlimited users AND devices. 

That was never going to happen. 

Instead of trying to make enough money to buy every primary leading IP from every studio Netflix went a different way. 

They produce content for you. It‚Äôs odd no, that there‚Äôs actually very little by way of promotion of lots of shows on Netflix but so many of the same type of people have heard of them.

Well, first of all, I think that buying into Netflix right now will not result in the same kind of profit that you would have gotten buying into Netflix like four years ago. But that's really obvious.

Your point of view sounds more like the view of an unsatisfied consumer. ""I don't like Netflix any more because there are too many competitors so I'll just pirate whatever I want instead of paying""

Well, it isn't like that for a lot of consumers. A lot of people rely on these streaming services to tell them what to watch in the first place.

If it‚Äôs less than 1, probably it‚Äôs undervalued.

If it‚Äôs more than 1, probably overvalued, but you can still project their growth and find its average because it can still be undervalued if they have some assumptions of future earnings or FCF.

I prefer FCF though since it‚Äôs harder to be manipulated than earnings.

The example I have in mind is Fred Meyers, ticker FMY, which was bought by Kroger years ago. There was a time when the Freddy's workers went on strike and I looked at it as an investment.

Freddy's was a 'one stop' grocery outfit, and surrounding the store was a bank, coffee shop, Taco stand, etc etc etc. Freddy's owned all the land. Hundreds of stores.

The 'average' land cost was booked at 150,000 after depreciation. But a lot of their expansion took place in the 70s and 80s. How much do you think an entire block in a busy area of town runs nowadays?

The stock was in the upper teens because of the strike. But I figured the land alone was worth $15-20 per share. It took 9 months before I sold in the low 40s.",Mister_Titty,1,/r/stocks/comments/nzye7p/value_investors_how_do_you_calculate_your/h1t48s4/,0.1,0.865,0.035,-0.7717
186,DCF," EV adds debt to market cap and subtracts cash to determine the true expense of buying a company.

In essence it says that market cap already accounts for cash and discounts for debt.

But then it doesn't subtract other assets or balance receivables and non-debt liabilities.

On the other side, when you calculate the DCF and multiply it by the multiplier, you then subtract the debt and add the cash before comparing to market cap. It just moves the debt and cash to the other side of the equation.

So the remaining bogey is the multiplier, which seems arbitrary. Applying the formula to a bunch of tickers should reveal whether it's too loose.",merlinsbeers,1,/r/stocks/comments/nzye7p/value_investors_how_do_you_calculate_your/h1t5mcb/,0.139,0.845,0.016,-0.919

207,SOFI," **SOFI**
summary of article from last night , saying Cup & Handle indicating a strong break out..

The author (excerpt below) is basically saying that a move above $23.75 in the next day or two (which completes the handle) ...would send Price much higher...

... (which lines up perfectly with what the
end of the order book has been showing all
week.. $23.50 is now basically the breaking
point for shorts...at which time the bulk of shorts will begin to cover quick and hard)... and after the 21M shares shorted the past two weeks, the total is around 45M shares..   **Also consistent with the weekly and monthly charts... indicating a strong move up today** ... Charts just posted on SOFI Stock Twits page.

**Article Quote/ Excerpt**
(Chart also  posted on SOFI Stock Twits page.. could not get image to post here)

It‚Äôs a classic in the world of growth stock investing. It‚Äôs called a corrective cup with handle base and it‚Äôs working on its finishing touches in SOFI stock. And for bullish investors that want a breakout play with the odds stacked in their favor, SOFI deserves a spot the short list of buys of this kind.

Technically and as the illustrated chart reveals, SoFi‚Äôs smaller handle consolidation has just entered its third week of construction. Development is occurring within the right side of the larger base and finding support off the 50% retracement level. At the same time, pattern resistance has formed at the 76% Fibonacci level.
Altogether, the construction of SOFI‚Äôs cup with handle is visually attractive for a nearby breakout and pending buy decision in SOFI stock if shares proceed to clear the high of handle.

Less characteristically of the cup-with-handle base, the handle‚Äôs depth of nearly 25% is wide by textbook standards of around 10%. More importantly , overall pattern volatility of both the cup and handle are observably congruent. And in this strategist‚Äôs estimation, that‚Äôs the overriding factor in setting up SOFI as a strong-looking cup with handle breakout candidate.",InvestorCoast,4,/r/stocks/comments/o0a9tf/rstocks_daily_discussion_technicals_tuesday_jun/h1u0lg3/,0.0,0.888,0.112,0.9882

I didn't get that from reading the report at all. Report mostly seems directed at SBTech (tech partner included in SPAC merger) which last quarter made up 10% of DKNG's revenue. You can check state revenue numbers from sports betting, they aren't hidden anyway, and DKNG's numbers can mostly be verified through that. The rest of the report mostly seems like DKNG turning a blind eye to it and the belief that they are well overvalued.

275,JPM," I'm not him but it's probably because you're looking at the U.K. ticker versus one of the offerings here in the U.S. Two different countries, two different tickers

Also the LSE does things in pence, which are basically cents, so the 100 isn't dollars. Since the U.K. and the U.S. are different countries, they use different currencies

So RR = 1 dollar.

I will say the guy who is posting is actually a fucking ape, because RYCEY is the U.S. actual play on LSE's RR. What he is talking about is RLLCF, which really has nothing to do with the stock itself and is a niche type of offering by RR through JPM that is similar to a bond. 

If someone is buying what he's talking about you're essentially playing on overall RR profit vs interest rates, which makes it (1) more risky/profitable but (2) importantly, actually makes what he's saying legitimate gibberish. If he thinks there won't be a profit for another year there's really no reason to put any money in RLCCF because you can't ""play"" zero profit.

They are going to give you a share of something. You choose when to sell it. Whatever you sell it for is now money in your account.

304,CRSR," >As i said, a very solid company with a bright future, great cashflow, good products and most importantly a very good brand name

sure... but it's in a cutthroat and an extremely low-margin retail hardware business.

I own this stock, I'm up on this stock, but I'm astounded at how many comments state it's a good stock because it's a good company. One doesn't follow the other especially in an industry with razor thin margins.

If the argument is ""rising tide lifts all boats and gaming is a rising tide"" sure, I buy that. But I've literally see people going ""gamers have strong brand loyalty and CRSR is like Apple with high quality products"".

But they don't, gamers have brand loyalty to consoles or systems. Other than that their loyalty is to playing more video games. If buying RAZER gear when their mouse breaks means they can afford more games on the next steam sale or GOG, most gamers are looking for the most affordable hardware that allows them to purchase more games.",oarabbus,2,/r/stocks/comments/o0fprr/sudden_crsr_price_increase_how_did_this_happen/h1vstku/,0.016,0.732,0.251,0.9927

It isn't totally free as you pay a subscription fee for the markets you want real-time data for, but the subscription fee is usually pretty low (depends on the exchange). The main benefit is that the Python API is pretty easy to work with. Basically you install Interactive Brokers Trader Workstation software on your computer, and then the Python API communicates with a running instance of the Trader Workstation, rather than communicating with a remote server, which IMHO makes life easier as a developer. For snapshot requests the limit is 100 per second which is something I also really like about their API.

368,NVAX," They still have contracts for a billion doses not counting the deal for serum institute/covavax. I believe an approval from outside the US will come prior to September when it is expected to receive US EUA. It‚Äôs being sidelined in the US bc I believe the tech is safer and people will flat out refuse to take an mRNA vax once NVAX hits the market and they don‚Äôt have all 8 factories completely online to handle the demand yet. The company‚Äôs future revenue prospects are insane and their market cap is tiny compared to peers. Once jabs in arms begin, they will melt up to Moderna equivalent cap which would put them at a pps around 5-6x what it is now. All that is even before you look at the long term prospects in their pipeline, adjuvant licensing for malaria drug which is stellar, Nanoflu, and combo Nanoflu/covid vax. Their safety profile and tech also allows them to create multivalent strains with the same amount of adjuvant meaning they will have the safest and most tolerable multivalent vaccine. mRNA vaccines cannot be produced for multiple strains in one shot without risking people‚Äôs health. They are the turtle in the race but will ultimately beat the hare(s). The problem however is in the meantime, the stock can be traded. Only 75 million float and it is heavily manipulated. Any minor setback news can drill it 40-50 bucks at anytime. If you can stomach volatility and you hate FOMO, hold. If you can‚Äôt, sell and try to time a re-entry.

386,VERY," Sideways markets are my favorite.  I've increased my portfolio by about 8.2% in 3 months even though my stocks I've been trading are only about 1% up the last 6 months.

Buying and holding is perfectly fine but for me the fun of the game is trying to ride these dips and gain when the market is flat. The flatness gives me confidence.

As I refined my process I do think someone can make quite a bit in the flat markets and that's where I've been focusing

401,GM," Typically in a bankruptcy, common stock shareholders are left holding the bag and the stock is eventually de-listed. The shares can trade hands for years on the OTCBB market, but they almost never recover.

The reason they don't recover is because they can only make money if the rest of the company's debt obligations are paid off and there's something left for common stock holders. That almost never happens.

If the company manages to turn things around, they are typically restructured and will issue new stock. Old shareholders aren't entitled to any of this stock.

GM is an example of where common stock shareholders were wiped out in 2009 when they filed Chapter 11. The company was renamed to ""Motors Liquidation Company"" who's stock was worth nothing. A ""new company"" named General Motors emerged from the wreckage, went public with the GM ticker symbol in 2010, and is now doing pretty well. But if you tried holding onto pre-2009 GM stock, you'd have $0 now.
