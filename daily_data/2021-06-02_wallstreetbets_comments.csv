Let‚Äôs say you have a 1/21/22 call on GME $300. And it hits $300 next week. You believe GME will continue to climb. Hold it. You can only lose your original invest with an option. If you buy 100 shares (exercise) at $300, you‚Äôd spend $30k. Let‚Äôs say you exercise @300 and the stock drops to $150. You just lost $15k, but if the stock drops while you still own the option you will only lose the original invest. 

Now, if the stock jumps to $350-$400 you‚Äôll have made a sizable amount of cash and can sell at any time you want before the expiry.

770,CHS," Great this country is starting to finally become more sensible. While weed should be legalized there should be better education on it and proper usage. Even if you‚Äôre a medical patient there‚Äôs not much you really learn until you‚Äôve been smoking for a couple years.

 There also needs to be a ton more coverage on CHS or Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome, a deadly disease some can develop after years of smoking but others have in just months or even just single usage of 5mg edible has caused a woman to have a 6hr vomiting episode. Other more intense symptoms for people who have larger episodes are the vomiting from hours to months where it is uncontrollable and impossible to keep down anything. Then after that there‚Äôs nausea, indigestion and difficulty with certain foods, seizures, fainting, acid reflux, kidney failure from dehydration, inability to regulate temperature with sweating tons while you sleep and constantly being freezing while awake, diarrhea and stomach pain for what could be a few days to months or even over a year for those who have it extremely bad. 

There‚Äôs not much information about this to most of the public and I believe that it‚Äôs causing many more people problems but they‚Äôre not as severe so they don‚Äôt tie it together with weed. After all ‚Äúweed is harmless‚Äù. I would like to see weed legalized all over and destigmatized along with more education on usage such as recommending use of a log journal to track your experience, amount used and then it would make for a better way to find strains that you really enjoy. There should also be some information in the dispensaries on walls that talks about it. They should also talk about how higher thc percentage does not equal better and ends up worse for your tolerance making smoking in the future less of an experience and more mundane. There should be a shift in the growing community to start pushing out lower thc strains under 20% rather than trying to push out artificial numbers from 35-42% like some of the growers in the medical program.",yahmandan,-4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nq8c5t/amazon_backs_federal_bill_to_legalize_marijuana/h09pu1b/,0.107,0.802,0.091,-0.8591

AMC has been slow to adapt to the technology age and has suffered as a result. They currently have more long term debt alone than they do assets. That being said they aren‚Äôt very solvent. Even with the uptick in equity they‚Äôve received from investors they still need to find a way to pay off this debt or eventually they‚Äôll have to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy which was predicted by many before the rise of meme stocks.

If it‚Äôs over that price you pay the 100* 44, if it‚Äôs under you‚Äôre out of the 30 since the deal was I‚Äôll buy It if it hits this price. Now the money is not instantly gone. You can sell that contract, that right for someone else to buy 100 of the stock at 44 at ANY TIME up to that date. As the stock goes up in value, and gets closer to 44 the chances of the contract being ‚Äúin the money‚Äù and exsible increases and therefore so does the value of the contract.

1521,AMC," Yes absolutely. If you sell options on memes, don't sell naked calls. Although some users of /r/thetagang like to do exactly that on out-sized moves like the one we are seeing now to sell super-far-otm calls to dumb money. Think selling 500 strike calls on AMC with short expiry (that strike is probably not available yet though). But that's just playing with fire and asking to get burned eventually.

In my opinion there is a much much better risk/reward to sell super-far-otm puts (cash secured, so you can take assigment) when memes start crashing with 1000%IV on puts even super far down the chain. Think 10 dollar AMC puts, maybe even lower than that. You can probably earn a relatively save 10% in one month that way. Worst case you own AMC at 10, that shouldn't be too bad.

1537,GME," GME NFT, e-commerce shift, booming gaming industry and a stacked competent board. While they were struggling in the pandemic, they cleared their debt and have a lot of runway now. They're definitely in no position to fail, only succeed or perform mediocre right now, but the turn around seems strong. Also has an insane cult following. Of course, boomers living in the 70ies don't understand half the stuff that's in play right now, so they'll reduce GME to brick and mortar reseller, so they'll never see any value in the play.",Mareks,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nqke1z/32k_in_a_day_theta_play_this_is_the_way/h0bdj8f/,0.127,0.71,0.163,0.5921
1538,OR," Not even a little. It's selling or buying a promise to purchase a minimum of 100 shares (1 contract = 100 shares of x stock) at a designated date and price per share for a premium you pay now. As a stock's price fluctuates you can either make a bunch of money due to the increased premium or lose the entire amount of premium you paid. The premium is 100x, due to the contract being equal to a future purchase/sale of 100 shares. 

Ex. You buy a contract for a premium of $0.25 of x share with the stock price at $30 (also referred to as strike price), so for $25.00 total, due to come up/expire July 2. But in a week it goes up to $0.50/share, because the underlying share price is approaching the $30 strike price, meaning the share value is getting close to what you were betting it would be in a month. So, in this case your contract will have doubled in value, a 100% return. You could sell it then and there for the return or continue to hold it if you believe it's got room to go before its expiration. However, if, as the date approaches, the stock value remains roughly the same as when you purchased the contract OR has decreased, your value of the contract will decrease through the premium value. BUT even if the price of the stock starts to increase, albeit gradually, you are losing value every day through theta decay, as the stock is less likely to hit the strike price by the date you specified, so your premium decreases as well.

TL;DR options are complicated with a lot of risk and a lot of reward. Definitely do some research and trial plays before just jumping in. With the downward pressure of the market starting in February pretty much all my gains that I made in January, enough for a year's salary, were wiped out, partly through getting into options with little background and at the wrong time. Slowly recovering now and took most money out as a result of the see sawing going on for the past months, but looking better and better now!

2260,AMC," I had about 75 shares with a $7 average. When it hit $33 and dropped down to like $26 I set a sell limit for 15 shares @ $33 which basically refunded what I invested. Everything else from here on out is pure profit.

Robinhood also as a commonality of ownership with one of the firms involved in heavily shorting GME, which I am a lot of people think raise serious questions about whether there was a conflict of interest that led Robinhood to restrict GME trading.

Funny thing is I remember as soon as I learn their restrictions on AMC I bought the max that I could, and then bought more through with my regular bank (Citi). You might say that I rage-bought AMC at around the same time I rage-quit Robinhood.

2865,IMO," We don‚Äôt but it would be stupid for states NOT to legalize it. If the state next to you is raking in millions in extra every year with marijuana sales, it would be a disadvantage for YOUR state NOT to legalize it. From a financial POV, it makes sense for every state to legalize it. That being said, this is a very slow process because it involves lazy politicians. But in a long term (5-10 years), this is a great investment. I have been holding APHA for a very long time (since 2017). But the reason why you are investing rn shouldn‚Äôt be soley due to shorting (even though this idea gets me wet) 

1. The merger of tilray and aphria was basically the most perfect thing that happened for both companies. Aphria has one of the lowest production cost associated with their products. They are involved in THC beverages, medications, edibles, medical patches, and many more. BUT their only problem was that they were not selling enough because they did not have the best connections (barely any sales in the states; most were in Canada). They literally had the space and the means to produce BUT not enough sales to push it all through. On the other hand, Tilray is completely the opposite. They have amazin connections and they dipped their toes in the US market a long time ago so they are very diverse in the US market. But they had HORRIBLE production cost (one of the highest) so it was hard for them to sell a lot even though they HAD many consumer interests. Overall, this recent merger is going to positively reflect the company.
2. Led my a solid team. Before APHA was led by some questionable leaders but now their leadership is amazing.
3. They are the biggest marijuana company IN THE WORLD. They will dominate in coming years
4. They are in Germany and many parts in europe ‚Äî> huge market
5. One of the lowest production cost

These are some pros but there are definitely more good things happening. IMO, in 5-10 years, this company is gonna be well off and dominate this sector. That being said, if this stock gets shorted, i will probably sell most of positions around $35-40 CAD and buy more when it drops back to $20 CAD range.",fifthjack_TTV,24,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nqa2me/tlry/h09k1u4/,0.092,0.81,0.098,0.6686

Therefore, once SOFI gets their banking charter approved, they no longer will have to borrow money at higher rates than JPM, BOA, etc... they don‚Äôt have to change their business model or anything and they reap the benefits of borrowing at lower rates.

Thank you for the clarification! ‚ù§Ô∏è 

So basically, l could buy this option contract which says that I could at anytime until the expiration date buy AMC share for $32 no matter what the market price is. However, I need to pay $605 to purchase this contact. 

And you purchased this contract because you believe that within the set expiration date AMC will skyrocket?üòâ

So if we supposed that within this period the share goes to $100 then you will have the right to buy it for $32 due to the contact which makes you a profit of $68 per share with a total of $6,800 üòç deducting the option price which is $605 you will exactly have $6,195 üòç

I do agree the IV is going crazy, but I got in at a much lower IV today, some of my OTM calls that cost me less than a dollar per contract are up over 3 bucks now (6/18 25c is 3.02)
