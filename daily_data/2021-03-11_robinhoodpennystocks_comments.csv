In practice they're not gonna pull the rug out from you but at the same time you bought an IOU. I'd get verified on a crypto exchange and then sell the IOU on RH and just rebuy on the exchange and set up a wallet. Some research to do and stuff it's annoying that's why crypto is so intimidating to the masses but it ain't bad lol.

Moreover, the reports noted that the photographed SOS ""miners"" weren't the A10 Pros the company claimed to own but were actually Avalon's A1066 miners.

321,DD," Honestly dude, my advice is to do some research into each stock before you sell. You may have gotten into these positions because of hype or FOMO but don't leave them unless you think leaving is the right move. Which you will only know from further research. This is especially true if you are trying to close out these positions so that you can hop on other hype trains. Do you DD, you'll find out which of your positions are still solid and which you should just cut your losses on.",Nibblitz,6,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m2w9ki/bag_holder_here_not_sure_how_to_proceed/gqlm0c0/,0.062,0.846,0.092,0.2643

344,ANY," Trump and the DOD made a mistake imo. The DOD didn‚Äôt give ANY detail as to why they would be delisted outside of a vague classification of categorizing their stock. 

They don‚Äôt need the NASDAQ to survive therefore they are NOT fighting for their lives. They are simply abiding by the NASDAQ requirements hence as to why they filed a temp motion restraining order to enjoin the U.S government from enforcing executive order restrictions. This order filed against the U.S government and signed by Trump has been deemed Unlawful and will prove the same within our court.",mattmaharST,-2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m2ty75/rhtd_and_others_have_restricted_buying_this_will/gqlks44/,0.039,0.939,0.022,-0.1754
