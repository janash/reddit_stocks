The style of sarcasm out of an average wsb’er could be quite misleading to the uninitiated who hasn’t yet learned the absolute necessity of DD and figuring out own personal risk tolerance.

Like Mr. Market Man, the higher a stock's price goes the more reddit tends to love it. Look at Tesla as an example of this. When I first joined this subreddit about the only people who liked Tesla stock as an investment were hard core Tesla fans, who were often heavily downvoted for suggesting people buy into such an 'awful' stock.

\>  230k shares ($23,000,000)

1 share != $100.

\> were called on Friday, this made the stock do that violent run to $70

Inaccurate, it's because of the gamma squeeze at concentrated strikes, not the raw number of shares being called.

\> I can't fathom what it's going to be like when 347 times that many shares are called at once. 

Where are you getting 347? It's a fallacy to think that all shorts must cover. Short interest has remained high because new shorts are ready to take over covering shorts, thus forcing short liquidation price higher. If GME runs to $1000, there'll still be 0 shares available to short.

\> That's why the MMs shorted more after the circuit breakers to try to keep the price down to limit their losses.

No. You're referring to option MMs, which try to remain net neutral on their deltas, which is why the gamma squeeze occurred in the first place. Using your logic, they could have just as easily went short and avoided the squeeze altogether.

What likely happened during the first circuit breaker is the MMs got on the phone with banks to see who'd be willing to sell them the opposing side of the risk so they didn't have to keep chasing neutral by buying. And banks want to do this because they know that, yes, it could possibly force margin calls on their clients due price running because of supply/demand imbalance.

\> They would rather short 2m shares than let the short squeeze hit on options exp day. 

You're inferring some 2m short number with option MMs, which also doesn't work like that. The option MMs are very likely net positive shares, and even if they weren't, they have a capability called naked shorting which is shorting without requiring a backing share to borrow.

156,BB,"Here is my quick and dirty amateur DD on BB (I'm a poet and didn't know it).

BB is in the businesses of 2 major industries/verticals:

* Cybersecurity
* Embedded systems/RTOS (Realtime Operation Systems)

On the cybersecurity side:

* Competes directly with CrowdStrike after their 2019 acquisition of Cylance.  Cyber security stocks have really taken off during the pandemic.
* Based on revenue, CrowdStrike is trading 270x revenue ($180M revenue in 2019 with current market cap around $49.5B)
* 2019 revenue for Cylance was around $100M.  If strictly going by revenue only (will get to EPS a little further below) and you apply the same multiple, just the security biz for BB should make the stock worth around $47 per share.
* Both CrowdStrike and BB (don't know the breakdown for the Cylance side of the biz only) are generating negative EPS according to Yahoo Finance.  -$0.49 for CRWD and -$1.49 for BB.  Almost 3x the loss for BB so it would be hard to justify the same multiple I mentioned above (unless if Cylance was either making money or not losing as much as CRWD before the BB acquisition).

On the embedded systems/RTOS side:

* BB's revenue peaked in 2011 and has been steadily and drastically declining since then.  Current revenue is only around 5% of their peak revenue in 2011.  If you are old enough to have heard Crackberry then you probably know what happened (Can someone say Apple?)
* Good news is 2020 was the first time BB saw year over year revenue growth.  Revenue growth was right around what the Cylance revenue from 2019 would have contributed.

Personal thoughts and opinions:

* Cybersecurity is in an unprecedented hot space right now (like lot of spaces atm).  The problem is that Cylance isn't a household name like CrowdStrike and BB is no longer a household like it was in the early years.  The CEO has some work cutout to change the image and perception of the company.
* EV and autonomous driving are in an unprecedented hot space right now.  :)  With the growth of these technologies, embedded systems/RTOS will play a greater critical role to help make the technology safe for consumers.
* Important to keep your automobile system secure to keep them from getting hacked and taking over control of your vehicle as the 2 mentioned technologies become more accepted and widespread.  I could see where BB could eventually position the 2 services together down the road.

My thoughts on how I could potentially value the stock price of the BB:

* Most software/SaaS/re-occurring revenue model companies are given a multiple of 30-35x by analysts.  Forget actual earnings for now - current market conditions are not normal.  Going to have to almost treat BB as a new startup where loss is expected vs an established company.  For the cybersecurity biz, it could contribute $3-3.5B to the market cap (30-35 x $100M)
* Companies that provide hardware or where they have to depend on new sales vs re-occurring revenue are normally give a multiple of 12-14x.  The embedded systems/RTOS (I'm not currently sure what the revenue model is for BB on this front, but assuming one time revenue for now) could contribute $10.8-12.6B in market cap.
* Current market cap for BB is around $8B.  Potential total market cap for BB could be around $13.8-16.1B ($3-3.5B + $10.8-12.6B).

Again, this was just a quick and dirty DD and my opinions only.  Getting the perception and image changed won't come overnight.  I could imagine long sales cycle involved in convincing other companies to commit to any solutions for embedded systems/RTOS as it would most likely be a long term strategic commitment.

I don't currently own BB at the moment.  I'm waiting to see if there are any signs of a slight pull back before I take an initial position.  After the initial position, I plan on tracking the company and the stock a little closer to see if it would be warrant increasing my stake.

* Current market cap for BB is around $8B.  Potential total market cap for BB could be around $13.8-16.1B ($3-3.5B + $10.8-12.6B).

Again, this was just a quick and dirty DD and my opinions only.  Getting the perception and image changed won't come overnight.  I could imagine long sales cycle involved in convincing other companies to commit to any solutions for embedded systems/RTOS as it would most likely be a long term strategic commitment.

I don't currently own BB at the moment.  I'm waiting to see if there are any signs of a slight pull back before I take an initial position.  After the initial position, I plan on tracking the company and the stock a little closer to see if it would be warrant increasing my stake.

160,EV,"Here is my quick and dirty amateur DD on BB (I'm a poet and didn't know it).

BB is in the businesses of 2 major industries/verticals:

* Cybersecurity
* Embedded systems/RTOS (Realtime Operation Systems)

On the cybersecurity side:

* Competes directly with CrowdStrike after their 2019 acquisition of Cylance.  Cyber security stocks have really taken off during the pandemic.
* Based on revenue, CrowdStrike is trading 270x revenue ($180M revenue in 2019 with current market cap around $49.5B)
* 2019 revenue for Cylance was around $100M.  If strictly going by revenue only (will get to EPS a little further below) and you apply the same multiple, just the security biz for BB should make the stock worth around $47 per share.
* Both CrowdStrike and BB (don't know the breakdown for the Cylance side of the biz only) are generating negative EPS according to Yahoo Finance.  -$0.49 for CRWD and -$1.49 for BB.  Almost 3x the loss for BB so it would be hard to justify the same multiple I mentioned above (unless if Cylance was either making money or not losing as much as CRWD before the BB acquisition).

On the embedded systems/RTOS side:

* BB's revenue peaked in 2011 and has been steadily and drastically declining since then.  Current revenue is only around 5% of their peak revenue in 2011.  If you are old enough to have heard Crackberry then you probably know what happened (Can someone say Apple?)
* Good news is 2020 was the first time BB saw year over year revenue growth.  Revenue growth was right around what the Cylance revenue from 2019 would have contributed.

Personal thoughts and opinions:

* Cybersecurity is in an unprecedented hot space right now (like lot of spaces atm).  The problem is that Cylance isn't a household name like CrowdStrike and BB is no longer a household like it was in the early years.  The CEO has some work cutout to change the image and perception of the company.
* EV and autonomous driving are in an unprecedented hot space right now.  :)  With the growth of these technologies, embedded systems/RTOS will play a greater critical role to help make the technology safe for consumers.
* Important to keep your automobile system secure to keep them from getting hacked and taking over control of your vehicle as the 2 mentioned technologies become more accepted and widespread.  I could see where BB could eventually position the 2 services together down the road.

My thoughts on how I could potentially value the stock price of the BB:

* Most software/SaaS/re-occurring revenue model companies are given a multiple of 30-35x by analysts.  Forget actual earnings for now - current market conditions are not normal.  Going to have to almost treat BB as a new startup where loss is expected vs an established company.  For the cybersecurity biz, it could contribute $3-3.5B to the market cap (30-35 x $100M)
* Companies that provide hardware or where they have to depend on new sales vs re-occurring revenue are normally give a multiple of 12-14x.  The embedded systems/RTOS (I'm not currently sure what the revenue model is for BB on this front, but assuming one time revenue for now) could contribute $10.8-12.6B in market cap.
* Current market cap for BB is around $8B.  Potential total market cap for BB could be around $13.8-16.1B ($3-3.5B + $10.8-12.6B).

163,BB,"What BlackBerry has been working to accomplish since 2015 is a fundamental shift in their business model from a low-margin hardware business to a high-margin enterprise software business. This has played out in two earlier phases spanning a decade, with the latest and most exciting third phase happening now.

1. **2011 - 2015: Restructuring.** By 2011, it was clear the iPhone posted a very serious threat to BlackBerry's mobile phone business. The question before the company during this period is: can we compete with Apple and if not, what do we do? The turning point came the first week of November 2013, when John Chen became CEO.
2. **2015 - 2020: software transition.** Chen decrees BlackBerry will be an enterprise software and services company. $BB picks up strategic acquisitions including file security firm WatchDox, networked emergency communications provider AtHoc, EMM vendor Good Technology, and cybersecurity firm Encription. All their acquisitions broaden the company's client base and their technologies are woven into $BB's existing enterprise software offerings. It is impossible to overstate the significance of the fact the company fully shed its mobile phone business - the product that defined the company - during this period and fully transitioned to a software company. In 2018, the company acquired Cylance, enabling BlackBerry to add artificial intelligence to its existing software products for the Internet of Things, a key category BlackBerry is competing in.
3. **2021 - present: Payoff.** The tremendous difficulty of executing such a sweeping turnaround meant the stock justifiably traded at a heavy discount during the John Chen software transition. But the ship steadied in 2019, when net income was $904 million. In 2020, revenue jumped to over $1 billion. The market is now recognizing the business potential of what has occurred in the decade since 2011 and re-pricing the stock.

I think the idea behind the QNX thesis isn't that it's new, it's that QNX has high potential value as EV becomes more common. Purportedly it's the best option for EV manufacturers to adopt - high security standards (I believe it's credentialed better than Tesla's operating system has managed) in a reliable real time microkernel OS. These are obviously important things in cutting edge EV where autonomous driving is the goal. 

So I think people feel like it will be adopted more broadly in new cars, while also being more critical to the actual functioning of the car than it has in the past with the huge increase in sensors and data that these cars will produce. The second piece that comes in is the IVY partnership with Amazon. IVY will provide an ecosystem for software to be developed and utilize that data in real time, and targets a recurring subscription or usage based revenue stream. QNX is arguably the type of solid foundation you would look for when implementing self-driving technology, while IVY will provide an ecosystem to build beneficial apps around that data stream. 

Whether that provides huge value, who knows.

That means that if the stock goes up for any reason, short sellers come under pressure to buy shares to close their short positions. But when the first short seller cracks and buys shares (taking a loss) they inadvertently drive the price up further, adding to the pressure on the other short sellers. Soon it’s a race to buy shares, but there simply aren’t enough to go around, so the price skyrockets before falling back down as shareholders finally take profits and sell. This is called a “short squeeze”. The only way a short squeeze is averted is if the stock price drops for some reason (like bad news from the company). GME is at ATH right now so it’s very unlikely that the short sellers will get out alive. It’s a matter of when they start to crack, not if. By all accounts they haven’t cracked yet, so the short squeeze hasn’t actually started.

What happened Friday was a “gamma squeeze”, which is unrelated to a short squeeze, but happens when call options are being bought extremely fast and the stock price is rising, which indirectly causes market makers to buy massive volumes of shares to hedge, driving the price higher, and so on.

The high probability of a massive short squeeze caused retail traders to plow money into shares and calls on Friday, which in then caused a gamma squeeze, causing the stock price to go higher, making the short squeeze even more likely.

If you have gambling money and you want to take part in this unique event, you either buy shares or call options. Shares are safer (since no matter when the squeeze occurs, you’re ready, while calls expire) but calls give you leverage. Calls, even far OTM and short expiry calls, are likely to be very expensive.

Unless we see Corsair really dominate market share in the coming year I'd have to imagine that between Razer and Corsair's sale growth (only two I follow) that we've seen a high amount of refresh from consumers so demand won't be as high after this winter and we could see a bit of cooling off.

306,ATH,"MMs were making lots of money shorting GME from 2013 to 2019. They had a good thesis, the company definitely was heading towards bankruptcy. However, things changed first when Michael Burry unexpectedly bought a large number of shares in the company, and close to the same time, GME started fighting against the trend, working on their balance sheet. This began with closing unprofitable stores that were bleeding money, which lead to GME being able to pay off their debts through this year and build over 500M in free cash flow. They also began to build their e-commerce presence, and started expanding into the online side of things.

So they were doing something, but really, would that turn their entire business model around? Probably not, the balance sheets indicated that limited access to funding could result in GME not having the resources to expand into a new business model, which was made difficult by the large amount of shorting.

Along comes some shifts to the board, including adding Reggie Fils-Aime, a great piece to have on the board, but still, it seemed GME was not shifting their strategies enough to warrant any alarm. Then this year, Ryan Cohen stepped into the spotlight, criticizing GME's board, and making threats that seemed to indicate he was going to get involved, possibly via a hostile takeover. Sure enough, he backed up his words with action, buying 9.8% of GME. This was an indicator that Cohen was ***in it***. Big time. The additional 4% buy not that much later, although this is now in late december, made it clear that Cohen was in it for the long haul, becoming a corporate insider since he owned greater than 10%, but also meaning that as a corporate insider, he would not be allowed to sell any stock for 6 months, as per SEC requirements for corporate insiders and insider trading.

So at this point in time, which was only 4-5 weeks ago mind you, the business as a whole had changed nothing regarding its business strategy, well not really, although it had definitely extended the possibility of bankruptcy to a more distant future. You see, most MMs were betting that GME would go to $0. Fully bankrupt. They were shorting it to non-existence, and they got close, the share price dipping as low as $3. Perhaps it was that they got close, close enough to smell the victory, close enough to smell the blood in the air that fueled their greed. They could have, at any point, cashed out their shorts and made away like kings, some of the MMs shorting since the company's ATH, hypothetically.

The battles truly began around Dec 3rd when GME released a rather unfavorable Q3 earnings. The company was still not profitable, although it was looking better than Q2, and not much had changed, except for some speculative interest from a young gun with a sharp tongue and an emoji-ridden twitter account. What could a mere 30 something year old do to disrupt GME's process to bankruptcy? It was silly, naive may have been a word that the various hedge firm managers used, casting aside any doubt that they had pegged a company on the fringe of going out of business, just like Blockbuster. You see, MMs had a thesis as well, and a good one. It had been working for 6 or 7 years. There was no reason to panic, everyone knows you shouldn't let your emotions get the best of you, right? Everyone agrees that B&M businesses are going out of business. The business world is changing, its going digital.

But alas, what happens when a company with a misguided and outdated business model really begins to change things? What if they get a new CEO, shift their business model, remarket themselves and transition their assets to something more... modern? Something that would work, perhaps even call it a fresh start.

Well certainly this is non-sense, they thought. No one can simply walk into a business, oust the chairman of the board of directors and seamlessly transitions a business without substantial losses and confusion, and ultimately, the efforts would be wasted. Surely!

I personally believe that the attention of just a very few were able to bring this dream to the public eye, starting with believing in Ryan Cohen. Maybe he could, in fact, strongarm his way into a position to execute his own vision. Perhaps he could implement similar tactics from his widely successful and renowned e-commerce Pet business, Chewy. Maybe this thing *isn't* going under.

Well, if it isn't going under, then holy heck, this company is under-evaluated by 400%, and Cohen could both change the perspective of the media and, and pivot this thing into something successful, at the very least profitable and far away from any bankruptcy. But that wasn't all, it did also mean that if GME wasn't going out of business, then what was going to happen to the shorts?

The price kicked up the teens, and MMs now fought to beat down this idea, by buying even more shorts, which was quite effective at keeping the price far below where it should be based on any quick glance at the company's direction, their balance sheet, their cash flow, their new e-commerce growth, or their future market value. A simple SOTP analysis suggested that GME was worth.... a lot more than what it was at. It was criminally undervalued.

And this idea got passed around. It made sense, and there were now some big names, and some really smart fellows, who believed in it. Cohen, Burry to name a few, but even Microsoft had some skin in the game ever since they teamed up with Gamestop to start sharing profits through their collaborating efforts...

MMs probably were beginning to sweat now. This was becoming a *story*, and they didn't like it. The articles began to pump out, declaring GME to be near bankruptcy, that prices were expected to lower, everyone was saying so, and every outlet, except one certain subreddit, was suddenly raising their pitchforks. Interesting timing, I do say, I wonder who gave out the word that GME was definitely, absolutely positively heading for bankruptcy, so no new investors should EVEN THINK about investing.

Uh-oh, it's not working. GME's up to $20. That dang Cohen is tweeting and getting all these dumb millennials to invest in something they know nothing about. Dang it. Cohen upped his stake to 13%, and everyone is all chatting expectedly about the upcoming ICR conference. People who invested at $12 are already close to 100% gains. So more shorts were bought, bringing GME back to $17

But then, Cohen took it a step further. GME announced that Cohen and two of his Chewy suits were joining the board, and several others were leaving. MMs didn't even have a chance before this lit the fuse...

***BANG!!!***

*We are in a tight spot!* said the MMs. So then they really started returning fire. This needs to be shot down before this gets any stronger. More shorts! Yes, more than ever before! People will realize their mistake.

But it was too late. GME was buzzing on the subreddits, and online news feeds were continuing to predicate that GME was going under, but they were up 100% in like two weeks? It didn't match up, and articles only continued to give GME more press. It built and built, although MMs tried keeping it down. Buy puts, common if they could just build a gamma ramp downwards they could end all the hype, and get the idea of bankruptcy back in people's heads. It could work, they just needed to...

***BANG!!!***

307,CEO,"MMs were making lots of money shorting GME from 2013 to 2019. They had a good thesis, the company definitely was heading towards bankruptcy. However, things changed first when Michael Burry unexpectedly bought a large number of shares in the company, and close to the same time, GME started fighting against the trend, working on their balance sheet. This began with closing unprofitable stores that were bleeding money, which lead to GME being able to pay off their debts through this year and build over 500M in free cash flow. They also began to build their e-commerce presence, and started expanding into the online side of things.

So they were doing something, but really, would that turn their entire business model around? Probably not, the balance sheets indicated that limited access to funding could result in GME not having the resources to expand into a new business model, which was made difficult by the large amount of shorting.

Along comes some shifts to the board, including adding Reggie Fils-Aime, a great piece to have on the board, but still, it seemed GME was not shifting their strategies enough to warrant any alarm. Then this year, Ryan Cohen stepped into the spotlight, criticizing GME's board, and making threats that seemed to indicate he was going to get involved, possibly via a hostile takeover. Sure enough, he backed up his words with action, buying 9.8% of GME. This was an indicator that Cohen was ***in it***. Big time. The additional 4% buy not that much later, although this is now in late december, made it clear that Cohen was in it for the long haul, becoming a corporate insider since he owned greater than 10%, but also meaning that as a corporate insider, he would not be allowed to sell any stock for 6 months, as per SEC requirements for corporate insiders and insider trading.

So at this point in time, which was only 4-5 weeks ago mind you, the business as a whole had changed nothing regarding its business strategy, well not really, although it had definitely extended the possibility of bankruptcy to a more distant future. You see, most MMs were betting that GME would go to $0. Fully bankrupt. They were shorting it to non-existence, and they got close, the share price dipping as low as $3. Perhaps it was that they got close, close enough to smell the victory, close enough to smell the blood in the air that fueled their greed. They could have, at any point, cashed out their shorts and made away like kings, some of the MMs shorting since the company's ATH, hypothetically.

The battles truly began around Dec 3rd when GME released a rather unfavorable Q3 earnings. The company was still not profitable, although it was looking better than Q2, and not much had changed, except for some speculative interest from a young gun with a sharp tongue and an emoji-ridden twitter account. What could a mere 30 something year old do to disrupt GME's process to bankruptcy? It was silly, naive may have been a word that the various hedge firm managers used, casting aside any doubt that they had pegged a company on the fringe of going out of business, just like Blockbuster. You see, MMs had a thesis as well, and a good one. It had been working for 6 or 7 years. There was no reason to panic, everyone knows you shouldn't let your emotions get the best of you, right? Everyone agrees that B&M businesses are going out of business. The business world is changing, its going digital.

But alas, what happens when a company with a misguided and outdated business model really begins to change things? What if they get a new CEO, shift their business model, remarket themselves and transition their assets to something more... modern? Something that would work, perhaps even call it a fresh start.

Well certainly this is non-sense, they thought. No one can simply walk into a business, oust the chairman of the board of directors and seamlessly transitions a business without substantial losses and confusion, and ultimately, the efforts would be wasted. Surely!

I personally believe that the attention of just a very few were able to bring this dream to the public eye, starting with believing in Ryan Cohen. Maybe he could, in fact, strongarm his way into a position to execute his own vision. Perhaps he could implement similar tactics from his widely successful and renowned e-commerce Pet business, Chewy. Maybe this thing *isn't* going under.

Well, if it isn't going under, then holy heck, this company is under-evaluated by 400%, and Cohen could both change the perspective of the media and, and pivot this thing into something successful, at the very least profitable and far away from any bankruptcy. But that wasn't all, it did also mean that if GME wasn't going out of business, then what was going to happen to the shorts?

The price kicked up the teens, and MMs now fought to beat down this idea, by buying even more shorts, which was quite effective at keeping the price far below where it should be based on any quick glance at the company's direction, their balance sheet, their cash flow, their new e-commerce growth, or their future market value. A simple SOTP analysis suggested that GME was worth.... a lot more than what it was at. It was criminally undervalued.

And this idea got passed around. It made sense, and there were now some big names, and some really smart fellows, who believed in it. Cohen, Burry to name a few, but even Microsoft had some skin in the game ever since they teamed up with Gamestop to start sharing profits through their collaborating efforts...

MMs probably were beginning to sweat now. This was becoming a *story*, and they didn't like it. The articles began to pump out, declaring GME to be near bankruptcy, that prices were expected to lower, everyone was saying so, and every outlet, except one certain subreddit, was suddenly raising their pitchforks. Interesting timing, I do say, I wonder who gave out the word that GME was definitely, absolutely positively heading for bankruptcy, so no new investors should EVEN THINK about investing.

Uh-oh, it's not working. GME's up to $20. That dang Cohen is tweeting and getting all these dumb millennials to invest in something they know nothing about. Dang it. Cohen upped his stake to 13%, and everyone is all chatting expectedly about the upcoming ICR conference. People who invested at $12 are already close to 100% gains. So more shorts were bought, bringing GME back to $17

But then, Cohen took it a step further. GME announced that Cohen and two of his Chewy suits were joining the board, and several others were leaving. MMs didn't even have a chance before this lit the fuse...

***BANG!!!***

*We are in a tight spot!* said the MMs. So then they really started returning fire. This needs to be shot down before this gets any stronger. More shorts! Yes, more than ever before! People will realize their mistake.

But it was too late. GME was buzzing on the subreddits, and online news feeds were continuing to predicate that GME was going under, but they were up 100% in like two weeks? It didn't match up, and articles only continued to give GME more press. It built and built, although MMs tried keeping it down. Buy puts, common if they could just build a gamma ramp downwards they could end all the hype, and get the idea of bankruptcy back in people's heads. It could work, they just needed to...

***BANG!!!***

361,BB,"Do not buy options with BB. If you want in, buy shares. This isn’t a squeeze and may not rise as quickly as all those retards think. Half of them apparently have no idea how to read a chart much less a gamma chart. $16 and up will be volume and news. Buy shares. Options can fuck you hard.

And if you’ve never played options, might as well burn your money in a fire pit. Understand how options actually work and study a chart. I love WSB but the big boys are the ones with the real money. BB was trading over 150 million in volume daily last week (they were averaging like 9 million prior) That’s not WSB. That’s billions in big dick institutions. Something is happening but we don’t exactly know what yet.

So buy shares. It’s much safer and ensures you a ride to the moon. I do believe in BB. Holding 2,000 shares at $9.65. Will buy more on dips.

There is a website that tracks WSB and the number of ticker symbol keywords per day.  If you look at the chart, WSB didn't start heavily talking about BB until AFTER the first day it spiked.

Shorts could’ve caved in and tried to begin to cover, but no they are doubling down still and the short interest still exceeds 100%.

I was hoping for a springboard of travel to boost the share price from Q2 2021 onwards. This seems to be looking less and less likely.

Negative factors include the new COVID strains, reduced vaccine production capacity (Especially in Europe at the moment) and increasing levels of travel bans / restriction requirements. The longer these negative factors exist, the more debt that EasyJet is having to take on board.

463,GME,"So obviously this is not professional advice... talk to your investment professional... the following answer is merely a matter of personal opinion... and all the other jazz we're required to make note of..... Now to start off, what kind of short term gains are you looking for? Is this money purely for investing? Or are you planning on buying a house in 10 months and you just want to collect some interest on it while it sits? If this is purely for investing and you are looking to chase big gains, then you need to be comfortable with taking big risks. One of the most fundamental rules of investing is that risk and reward are *almost* always proportional to each other. In regards to GME, you have NOT missed the GME wave. The rocket ship short squeeze everyone is hyping up about has not happened yet, but will very likely happen early next week. The current price is likely not very far off from what the company is fairly valued at given it's current financials. So if the price doesn't explode, it will likely hold relatively close to it's current price (+ / - ~$10). This means if you buy into GME on Monday at it's current price, your risk should be relatively moderate and the potential rewards are astronomical. Just something to consider. If you want to passively make easy gains that you don't have to research and individually select yourself, go with a low cost mutual fund that has a long history of decent gains. Throw it all into something like VIGAX or VWUSX. These will all be moderate risk, and will provide an average investment gain of 10% - 15% per year.",0.042,0.824,0.133,0.9784

- first you dont know how long it will take for the valuations to come back to normal (next bubble pop)

- and second, you are basicly loosing money with the 0% intrest rates and the high eventual inflation projected from printing all those Trillions..

Just immagine this keep going for 2-3 years as the FED already said not planning to increase interest rates untill 2023, that might turn 24/25 or stay low forever (look Japan) and trust me they can keep printing money for that long term too.. so the stocks will keep going up unless theres another catalist happening such as war or another health scare like the covid we are in now...

My tought is depending on how defensive you (and I in this case) want to be, is to use 1/3rd  up to an half or 2/3rds of your liquidated portfollio and invest that in Gold, Silver, Miners, and Value Companies that are still not super overvalued by todays standard.

They will all go down in even of a crash, but less as they arent so overvalued, and will rebound much higher after on the way up o recovery as people will be afraid to invest in the voliate stocks.

so if you only use 1/3rd of all your money to do so in event of big crash (50% lets say) youwould be down only 1/6th for a perioud of time, and will have the rest 2/3rds to buy discounted stocks

Economics does influence a great skill set though, like critical thinking and problem solving. 

Now if you are open to the idea of venturing out of either of these, as one redditor said you should get a math degree. If you believe you are good enough at math, this is the easy answer. Math majors get looked at as smart, people want to hire smart people.

518,CEO,"Your timeline is pretty terrible regarding covid with a lot of false assumptions.

First, the current rate of vaccinations and supply simply do not match your timeline. The current rate of vaccinations are 1 million doses per day. The vaccine works on a 2 dose regimen per person. US wants to vaccinate around 75% of the population or \~250m people. Therefore, at current rate it would take 500 days to reach that target. More vaccines will be coming in the next few months, so the rate will increase. Assuming the rate doubled starting today, we still wouldn't reach that target until October.

Second, vaccines don't actually prevent infection. They only reduce the severity of symptoms. This means that covid will never go away as long as humans are alive to spread it.

Third, this isn't taking into account the durability of ""immunity"" of which studies have shown that antibody levels wane after several months. It is unknown exactly how long protection might last, but it is thought to be around the 6-12 month range which is consistent with the fact that people have been re-infected with covid. This means that more shots will be needed even if everyone were to get vaccinated.

Fourth, the virus is mutating. It is said that it's becoming more infectious at a minimum, and potentially deadlier as well. The virus will not stop mutating and will be around just the same way the flu is. The vaccines will not protect against every variant of the virus. The CEO of Moderna even commented on how long we'll have to live with the virus. His answer, ""Forever.""

So the virus is never going to go away. But that doesn't mean life won't return to some form of normalcy at some point. Much the same way we learned to live with flu, we will learn to live with covid.
