Group 2: Likewise, if you sell a call and the call is in the money then that buyer will eventually exercise the option and you'll have to provide the stock. Unless the stock dips enough.

Group 3: If you sell a call and the call is out of the money then the option might expire worthless so you might not have to eventually provide a stock to someone.

Now also imagine that the number of GME shares that people are actually willing to sell to those guys is **less** than what's needed.

More demand than supply means that the price will go up. As it goes up, group 1 is getting fucked and group 2 is starting to get scared that they're really going to have to buy the stock. So group 1 tries to get out of their mess buy ""unshorting"", aka buying stock.

That's brings the price up so group 2 is starting to freak out because it's looking more and more like they will need to eventually buy that stock. So now they are buying stock before it gets too expensive.

That pushes it higher and now group 3 is looking to buy. Pushes even higher.

The infinite part is because you can end up in a situation where the number of stocks that need to be bought is more than the number that exist.

The gamma squeeze is when the people that own the stocks also buy some call options. That makes groups 2 and 3 bigger, which hikes up the price for the group doing the squeeze.

EV currently is around 5bn.

Given CHWY was cohen’s brain child. It’s reasonable to expect GME will develop a similar business model like CHWY in 4-5 years time.

GME’s revenue is 5bn which gives EV/revenue of around 1.0x. 

GME is expected to turn EBIT positive within 2 years. Their ecommerce share of total revenue is close to 1/3 already. Given low interest rates are to stay for a couple of years, future and present values are very close. That means the fair value of GME should greatly take into account their future value, which is worth a lot.

82,GME,"Okay so a ""Jan 29 $115 call option"" means that at market close on Jan 29, whoever owns that contract has the OPTION to purchase 100 shares of GME for $115.  (Options are traded in contracts, each one is a deal for 100 shares of the stock.)

So let's say you think GME is going to $420.69 and I'm a bear who thinks it's done and the squeeze won't happen.  I'll sell you that 210129GME$115c for let's just say $50. If GME is above $115.50 (stock price plus the $50 you paid divided by 100 shares) on Jan 29 at 4pm est, you've made money. You then ""exercise"" the contract and I now have to sell you 100 shares for $115 each - which you can immediately turn around and sell for current market value.

A put option is basically the same thing, but in reverse. You're paying for the option to SELL 100 shares at the strike price, on that date. I'd be offering to buy them from you at that price - even if the price of the stock goes to 0. So you could buy the 100 shares on the market for peanuts and make me buy them for the strike price.

You can also turn around and sell an option to someone else - so if GME shoots up to $200 on Jan 26, maybe someone is now willing to buy that contract from you for $8500 ($200-115=85, times 100 shares). If you're worried that your 420.69 prediction was a bit too optimistic, you could sell and make $8450 profit.

It's really going to depend on what 2/5 expirations look like.  During the first halt all of the unwinding occured in the 1/29 expirations first and then the 1/22s tried to unwind during the second halt.

Let's say you own 10,000 shares of GME.  Let's say GME hits $800.  In order for you to make any money, someone has to be willing to BUY those shares from you.

Read the posts that people made on Friday during the spike.  TONS of people were complaining that their sell orders did NOT fill until it crashed back down.

You know why?  Because no one was willing to put in BUY orders at that price.

If no one was willing to put in buy orders at that price, who the hell is going to buy your shares at $800?  Would YOU buy your GME shares at $800/share?

No, of course you wouldn't because that would be dumb as hell, because the next thing that happens is the stock crashes down to $20/share.

This is historically the problem with short squeezes.  Only a FEW people make the real money, everyone else sees there shares become WORTHLESS.  

The main people behind the scenes pushing this GME thing are hoping to make YOU the bag holder... they are planning to be the first ones to sell, and thus the only ones who make the real money.",0.134,0.805,0.061,-0.9563
227,PLTR,"TLDR:  only 20% of all common shares are currently market eligible.  Remaining 80% will be market eligible on 2/12 post earnings.  % of market eligible shares = dilution rate

Part of the direct listing S1 is the lock out period.  Palantir investors who were eligible for the common shares on IPO day only received 20% of their allotment.  

Example:  if you bought 1000 shares pre IPO at a par of 7.50 (which is where the IPO opened at on market day 1) you as an investor only were given 200 shares for you to either hold or divest.  

Your remaining 800 shares (or 80%) would become market available after the lock out period.  Lock out just happens to end on 2/12 which is the day AFTER earnings.

There is already an institutional demand for PLTR.... And George Soros has already pledged to fully divest, but there is an agreement with Level 3 for a direct transaction.  Catherine Wood already bought an additional 500k shares for ARKW which chewed up any latent float out there.  So price action is happening in ask/bid based on volume vs available shares

230,DD,"The risks really depend on what you see as the full value of the stock. For example, some short sellers think the true value is $20. Because these are stocks, and not options, the most you can lose is if the price were to drop from where you buy down to 20.

However, a lot of other people think that the full value of the stock is actually much higher - between 70 and $100, or more. This is based upon Ryan Cohen turning GameStop around like he did chewy.com.  stock until it reaches that fair value.

But what has happened currently with the stock is detached from fundamentals. It's a technical issue. If you read those two DD posts I linked, it might help you understand what a gamma squeezes and what a short squeezes. Basically too many people borrowed shares thinking that the price would fall. As the price rises from retail investments, these short sellers have to buy shares to cover their short sales. That drives the price higher. 

You can look up the VW short squeeze of 2008 to understand where this could go in the short-term, before it returns to a fundamental value.

If I set a stop loss at GME $45.00, My max loss is around $3500. An amount I'm willing to lose for this insane bullish bet. However, for every $50 gme moves, I would make 10k *actual* profit. 

So.. max loss is $3,500... but max gain is Almost 100k if I let GME hit $500. Am I missing something here? Seems like insane upside vs downside. Big concern being that my stop loss wouldn't trigger @ $45 because there would be no buyers.

I could talk about all of the DD and TA for many more paragraphs, but I don't suppose anyone is looking to hear that.

But even a simple 6 month, 1 month, or 1 week chart analysis is bullish, the 200MA has crossed the 50MA (golden cross), tons of candlestick patterns, cup and handle etc. A simple SOTP analysis shows GME on their current fundamentals alone has a suppressed stock price of 4x underevaluation (well that was back when GME was at 20, so around 70 or 80 for current balance sheet), but that doesn't even price in future value, that's for hitting like a P/E of 1",0.051,0.859,0.09,0.9683

A lot of people so far have decided its heading up, and have factored in where these gamma or short-squeezes could land them. And well, the price points get freaky.

Usually I would say yes it is a game of poker. But you also know that since the market crash in 2020, this game of poker has shifted from gambling to something different. Everyone knows how inflated the stock market has become since March last year. Pick a random stock and there's a good chance it's up 30% or more since March lows. Pick a tech stock, and there's a good chance its up 100% since lows. For GME, I don't view it as gambling at all. I view it as evaluating a business' direction and future strategy and getting in early. If people knew who Ryan Cohen was, and his history and what he has been doing since Chewy, they would understand that he intends to take Gamestop and pivot the business around to become an e-commerce videogame giant in the industry. That's most people's guess, that is the only uncertainty, his exact business strategy, but its safe enough to bet that he has a good one.

I think double digit market cap is reasonable by EOY without looking at short squeeze potential. As for what can go wrong? It’s hard for me to say because they survived global pandemic and short attacks while holding a ton of cash, which at one point was half their market cap. They do have $100m potential shelf offering in their pocket, which I actually think would be a positive thing down the road because they can use those proceeds to payback debt, therefore increasing their bond ratings and attracting institutional investors that once couldn’t put their money in because of their current bond ratings. 

With Ryan Cohen seemingly gathering control, I’m seeing a ton of upside with little downside. 3 members of the board are retiring and if they’re filled with his people, that’d be huge.

508,GME,"What you need to understand with GME is pretty much the same as with any stock.

Stocks do not have their own value. They are worth nothing if no one buys (or for that matter sells) them. 0. The entire value of stocks comes for multiple reasons but this is why P&D is so effective. 

The main reasons companies go up is usually:

\-Potential

\-Accomplishments

Since certain companies also pay dividends there is a solid interest in getting in as low as possible and once the value goes far up related to their increasing income you earn more (technically, in theory).

But the other side is what was done at the same time, ""artificially"" bloating the value of a stock. Gotta put that in quotation marks because even with great innovations and profit, if a company is not in the eyes of a large audience the stock price will barely change - so the artificial bloating is mostly spreading awareness. In some cases, this causes the stock to reach a value that fits alongside the market and is considered normal, while previously being undervalued.

In GMEs case their value dropped for a reason, they are highly outdated and made their moves way too late. They have a technically promising future, but only if they manage to speed up a lot without sinking on the way AND have to compete in an established, fully satisfied market, which is never easy.

So GMEs value is right now not bond to potential or accomplishments, but purely to artificial bloating. This is pretty much what happens in a P&D, and if you have ever seen one or invested while one was going on, that's the answer as to what could happen. Since this case here is more of a fight to cause certain market reactions, it might go on for a while. It might actually go on for insanely long and be a back and forth. Due to this entire thing GME has gotten more attention than in ever, meaning more people will jump on buying the stocks. It doesn't matter if only 1/100 that hear about it invest into it, if 100.000 people see it that's 1000 new investor meaning higher demand, meaning less supply.

The main danger in this thing is those tipping over that hold the most value right now. If they decide to leave the boat, either because they don't see a point in continuing because they made xx millions or start having a feeling the fight is turning and they will lose their profit slowly but surely, then they will jump off. GME will fall hard at that point, really hard. Usually with P&D the fall is fast to a certain degree but caught by the amount of new investors not understanding what's going on. For GME, most know what's going on and I would be very surprised if people haven't set up stop loss orders close to the current price, maybe 10% below it.",0.058,0.789,0.153,0.9937

For GME I’ve seen others more knowledgeable than me say this ratio is closer to 1.5:1. Not sure why nobody is talking about this, but my takeaway is that it’s going to be much easier for short sellers to buy back the stock as the price increases slight and retail investors want to realize their gains.

Let's say you own 10,000 shares of GME. Let's say GME hits $800. In order for you to make any money, someone has to be willing to BUY those shares from you.

Read the posts that people made on Friday during the spike. TONS of people were complaining that their sell orders did NOT fill until it crashed back down.

You know why? Because no one was willing to put in BUY orders at that price.

If no one was willing to put in buy orders at that price, who the hell is going to buy your shares at $800? Would YOU buy your GME shares at $800/share?

No, of course you wouldn't because that would be dumb as hell, because the next thing that happens is the stock crashes down to $20/share.

This is historically the problem with short squeezes. Only a FEW people make the real money, everyone else sees there shares become WORTHLESS.

659,GME,"GME is one of the most shorted stocks in the market. That means that many people borrowed shares to sell them high, betting that the price will go lower, then later they will buy the stock, closing the position.

This means 1st, that they have to borrow the shares, and they pay interest on this. 2nd, that they sell the stock they don't actually have yet, and third, they have to buy the stock back at a cheaper price for it to work out.

This is a very risky move, because if the price goes up and not down, you've already sold the shares at a cheaper price and now you have to buy them back at a more expensive price to close your position. The potential loss is massive.

If the stock price starts to move up dramatically, the banks may margin call you, making you put up collateral to cover potential losses. If it goes up too much, you will probably have to bite the bullet and buy the shares to cover your short.

When GME went from $15 to $35, this put the short sellers in a bind. Do they continue to short? Or do they eat the losses. Most continued to short.

There's a few other things that could trigger a run up, thus ""squeezing the shorts""

One being call options being exercised. Many in the money options expired today. Those getting. Exercised forced the banks that sold those options to buy the stock at current value and sell them to you at the lower strike price. This buying helped build upward momentum. The stock goes up to $55, and now some large short sellers start to run for cover and buy to cut their losses, more upward movement.

Once one big position starts to cover, it creates a chain reaction because as the price moves up, more short sellers are forced to cover, making the price move exponentially.

One more thing is the fact that since more shares were shorted than are actually available on the open market, (I believe that at one point WSB claimed to hold about 8% of the total shares on the market) that meant that all those short sellers running to cover their positions are trying to buy stock that nobody has to sell them.

Did my best to explain what a short squeeze is while typing on a mobile phone. I'm sure it's not the most perfect explanation, sorry if I missed anything.

One more thing to note. A really good short squeeze is rare because it needs some really perfect conditions to align. (Very high percentage of shares are shorted, unexpected upward catalyst, low percentage of shares available on open market, bonus if high amount of long calls sold)",0.081,0.842,0.077,0.0275

Also, as long as you have the funds then you can sell a CSP. You just have to be able to purchase the shares if you get assigned. You don’t need to own them already.


Buying 100 shares on Monday won’t make a difference in my opinion. Either sentiment is there or it isn’t. If you buy and end up getting assigned then you would still have some shares. However if the demo day busts (which it probably won’t) then you could buy in lower.",0.044,0.9,0.056,0.34

714,LMT,"is not bad to be defensive,

just keeping everything in dollars is not good idia eiter..

- first you dont know how long it will take for the valuations to come back to normal (next bubble pop)

- and second, you are basicly loosing money with the 0% intrest rates and the high eventual inflation projected from printing all those Trillions..

Just immagine this keep going for 2-3 years as the FED already said not planning to increase interest rates untill 2023, that might turn 24/25 or stay low forever (look Japan) and trust me they can keep printing money for that long term too.. so the stocks will keep going up unless theres another catalist happening such as war or another health scare like the covid we are in now...

My tought is depending on how defensive you (and I in this case) want to be, is to use 1/3rd  up to an half or 2/3rds of your liquidated portfollio and invest that in Gold, Silver, Miners, and Value Companies that are still not super overvalued by todays standard.

They will all go down in even of a crash, but less as they arent so overvalued, and will rebound much higher after on the way up o recovery as people will be afraid to invest in the voliate stocks.

so if you only use 1/3rd of all your money to do so in event of big crash (50% lets say) youwould be down only 1/6th for a perioud of time, and will have the rest 2/3rds to buy discounted stocks

729,GME,"I’m playing it purely for the squeeze right now.  Been watching it since September, dipping in and out, and finally decided to jump back in last week.  

Liquidated my account yesterday and went 100% GME this morning.  Was expecting bullish movement, but not to the extent it jumped today.  Actually had my sights set on early February for big moves.

I think there’s still room to run, and Monday should be exciting.  Think about this, every open call option on the option chain expired deep ITM today.  How many of those 1/22 60C do you think were either sold naked, or part of a synthetic short after brokers ran out of shares to  borrow?  There was 25K open interest on the 60C alone.  These shares will need to be delivered next week.  

It also appears that short interest is still above 100%.  To be fair, some of this may be new shorts who got in in the last 2 days, but there is a good chance of them getting blown out next week as the options from this week are settled.

I have seen it purported that today was not driven entirely by a short squeeze, and that a gamma squeeze played just as much a part in the movement, as frenetic call buying on the run up led to increasing hedging by MMs.

All things considered, it seems like GME still has legs.  With the opening of higher strike options in the option chain as of today, and the settlement of this weeks options, we may see another few days of crazy price movement.  I plan to see what the premiums are and if they look good throw in for some 1/29 100Cs.

I plan to sell incrementally on the runnup.  However, I do plan to buy back in at a smaller position after the stock stabilizes.

I believe that GME has the potential to be a good value play after the squeeze is over.

I base this on a number of factors:

1.) Ryan Cohen is a savvy, driven dude with a solid understanding of what makes a company both successful and develop a loyal user base
2.) GMEs consistent growth in digital sales 
3.) partnership with Microsoft on digital sales (I expect other developers to make similar arrangements)
4.) growth of video games and esports revenue
5.) purchasing data linked to rewards card.  GME moving to an online marketplace will allow them to monetize user data

All of these things are of course contingent on a solid road map to transition to a more e-commerce based model.  But if anyone can do it it’s Ryan Cohen, I mean, he did it for pet food.",0.015,0.825,0.16,0.9968

I'm planning to sell at set increments, starting over $100 and going all the way up to $1000. I'm not confident it will definitely go that high, but I believe there's a good enough chance to take this risk.

 If I end up selling all of my shares, I will be buying back in as the price settles and holding long-term. I believe this company has a chance long-term and I'm already impressed with the changes they've made in the last 12 months.

 At the start of the pandemic, their online system was a mess. I ordered a used console for pick up one day before my state suddenly shut down all retail stores, and it took 2 weeks to get this issue worked out  (the system was overwhelmed and they couldn't reroute this purchase to my home).
