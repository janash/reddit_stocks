18,HUGE," Personally, I bought in the 2.00's.  By play is to leave it in for 2021.  If it shows progress it moves to a 2-3 year play.  If it strikes out then the plan is to  take the left over dollars and find another play.  Trying to play any stock short term is always risky let alone a speculative play.  They have a chance at a HUGE oil find so let them do their thing and will find out by end of year if they are right or wrong.  

These are the plays as long as they are meeting their catalyst I am happy to stay for the ride, i.e. hitting their deadlines like I posted above.",10xwannabe,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/ni3xiy/recaf_review_and_timelines/gyzzv6c/,0.08,0.697,0.223,0.9504
19,ALL," If you want the downsides of the play the article, EVEN if true, doesn't matter as that has nothing to do with the downside risks of the play.

Here are the downside risks:

1. They don't find commercial extractable oil.  They have already found oil so that is not an issue.  The already released it as a active hydrocarbon system which is a VERY specific term in the O/G industry.  They can't say that as that unless it is true, otherwise it is illegal.  If they weren't sure and were just trying to pump up the price they would have just been more vague to protect themselves from legal liability.  They are not stupid even if they were/ are crooks.
2. If they do find commercial extractable oil Namibia renegs and boots them out of the play to keep it all for themselves.

The above are real concerns.  ALL the stuff in the NG article don't matter for the investor.  For example, lets say they are ALL true and recon still finds commercial oil, what happens?  The guilty go to jail and the shareholder STILL makes A TON of money as that doesn't affect their shares.  It isn't like the SEC is going to take the shares away from the investor.  So, for me at least, I don't see any of those accusations, even if ALL true, as any negative.  This ALL comes down to... can they find oil they can dig up in a CONVENTIONAL manner or not.  If they do we make money and if they don't we lose money.  It really is that simple.

I absolutely do think Steinke played a pretty slick move in getting money by how he moved the rights to the play around, but keep in mind ALL of these transactions were passed through the regulators at the time with no issues so it isn't like they are going to have an issue with them now when they knew about them then when they allowed it.  He was VERY smart not taking on a management role with Recon as that would have made it an arm-arm length transaction vs. a current arm's length transaction.

I do agree folks should be aware of the downside risk of the play, but the NG has no bearing on the downside risk TO THE INVESTOR.  If true those guys will go to jail so all the risks are to the involved management team not the owners (shareholders).  That outcome doesn't bother me as it doesn't affect me making money on the play (which is ALL related to pulling oil out of the ground).",10xwannabe,6,/r/pennystocks/comments/ni3xiy/recaf_review_and_timelines/gz0wxgq/,0.097,0.8,0.103,0.753

22,ALL," So you think if they found several billion dollars of oil and sign JV partnerships to extract BUT the SEC throws everyone in the board in jail the SP would fall?   One's shares represent  the discounted price of future revenue.  So how would that be affected by folk's going to jail?  Now short term SP may/ will be affected but for the long term investor the ONLY thing that is going to affect it up or down is the oil itself.

When BP had their oil spill in Gulf or Toyota airbags killed a whole bunch of folks in the end it didn't matter because each share's value ONLY matter if they stop selling oil or cars respective.

This the EXACT reason I love these catalyst plays.  As an investor it is easy to know when to stay in or out of the play.  It ALL matters on them doing when their job is, i.e. to find/ pull oil out of the ground.  That's it.  That is why I posted this for folks who wanted the timelines of each upcoming catalyst on that quest.  If they fail at that  yes the SP will drop (as it should).

Like I said I am realistic and there are REAL risks (the one's I mentioned) outside of not finding oil, but  being a crook doesn't affect them finding/ selling oil.

26,DD," Oh that I agree this likely increases a chance of a hit piece.  That is not big deal to me about a hit piece.  The reason is if the company hits oil and pull out a few billion barrels (much more conservative then the current estimates of its potential) I don't see it LESS then current price, do you?

32,GS," To be real honest with you, I have no clue. That's why I posted here. I wished someone with more knowledge than me could give his opinion about this situation.

For now, I don't really know what to think about the financing debt of 60 millions of Road Runner. They seems to be confident in their business model to get such a financing and they have partnership, but this is OTC and they already have a large cap (70 millions). My guess is that the stock will rise back to .05 cents at some point because of GS hype, and that it will tank when they'll release the name of the merge. To me, the company operate in a non-sexy field, so I think the hype will vanish real quick.

The only way that I see that it could be hyped up, it is if they announced the merge + a publicity partnership with big corporation (they can do road publicity with that kind of technology so that could be an opportunity).

35,OR," If you're in the US, before anything else, go to OTCMarkets.com, and enter each one of your stocks into the search bar (one at a time). Each stock's page will say on the upper right corner what its status is: Pink, Pink/Limited Info, Pink/No Info. If it says Pink/No Information, and has a little picture of a stop sign, you're most likely going to need to sell those stocks before September, otherwise you won't be able to sell them at all.

Some of the No Info stocks are working on getting current, so you don't need to panic with them. I was able to find some of that by searching the ticker on Twitter. The ones that are not doing anything to get current need to go. As far as we've seen, no broker is going to allow you to buy OR sell these stocks, so you'll be stuck with them.

Once you've figured out which stocks need to go, you can work on the other suggestions you've gotten here. Averaging down to minimize loss has been my main move. Look at the total price you spent for each stock, and decide how much of a loss you can deal with. You may have spent so little on some that it's not worth the effort to try to average down.

I've spent the last few weeks trying to clean up the mistakes I made in the beginning. It's a pain in the butt, and you will lose some money, but it feels great to get that dead weight off your shoulders!

ETA: To clarify, there are a few more things the stock status could say, but you're just looking to see which ones are Pink/No Information. If you're like me and keep a paper notebook, be sure to mark the stocks you need to drop (you mentioned you're an older investor -- I'm 47, and don't quite trust digital records).",NothingReallyAndYou,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/ni9o3x/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gz2171z/,0.087,0.863,0.05,-0.8152
36,DD," Similar situation. I think I bought into stuff on hype and other people's DD way too much, through inexperience and excitement.

That said, as I've held companies it's helped me get a better feel for them over time and cull ones I have no confidence in and average down on some I think are underpriced.",co_fragment,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/ni9o3x/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gz0w0up/,0.038,0.799,0.163,0.802
37,DD," I was in a similar situation. I sold some at a loss and then added a little more money to my account. Note, this is my play account so we're not taking serious money. I was then able to average down a few other stocks and get out with some gains in some cases.  From there I have made better choices and picked better entry points. I'm still down about 18% overall but my portfolio is in much better shape and I have some winners I am holding. I think I'll be whole again by summer. 

I sold positions that freed up the most cash which gave me the ability to average down on smaller positions and get out whole on some of those or very close on others. 

My biggest change in my investing strategy was watching my entry points. DD is hit and miss and there are so many PnD stocks. I started focusing on getting stocks that have previously traded higher but for one reason or another are near 52 week lows or at low positions that historically have represented stops.  So far so good for me but again, my penny stock account is the same as sitting at the blackjack table. Strictly for fun. This is not financial advise.
