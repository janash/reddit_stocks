19,DD," First off, I would always pref that you do your own DD on the stock you might want to buy. 

Even tho yahoo does have some great DD at times, they always seem to have an urge to tell you why this stock did dip 4% today.

Let’s take apple as an example, if apple went down 4% they seem to know the (Real reason why) it’s going down.

But it might just simply begin there where more sellers then buyers, or that the hole market is down.

I won’t give any names on stocks or news sadly, as I don’t want to be the reason someone does invest in a stock that these wepsites, or news are pushing. 

One great advice(not a financial advicer and you do listen or not at your own risk)

is find out what your goal is, are you looking for a 10-30years investment to just sit around. Or do you want to find that goldmine, that gives you a huge payment.

What is your risk tolerance like. Look at the market right now, it’s red all around. But if you believe in the company you invested in, you should not worry to much about day to day gain/loss.

I have had stocks and stil do, that had a total value of 250k last week. And is now sitting on a value of 110k. But I believe in my investment, and therefore don’t care if it drops or not. 

Watch YouTube or something that does help you to know what you should be looking at, when doing a DD of a stock you think is worth the investment.",Alarming-Belt9439,1,/r/stocks/comments/mbw5zv/tip_yahoo_finance_app_is_awesome/gs3k8rl/,0.017,0.862,0.121,0.9756

Having said that their picks this are doing abysmally this year and much worse than any index. However, it was the exact opposite last year and overall if you go back to the beginning of last year many of their picks have doubled, tripled or more.

Motley Fool isn't s substitute for doing your own DD, but it can give you an idea on some potential growth opportunities, and then you do the DD on those companies you wouldn't have otherwise heard of.

The Motley Fool Investment Guide I've found to be an invaluable resource in picking stocks. Using the advice in it during this past year (my first year actively managing any investments) my portfolio has doubled the S&P's performance.

158,AI," You said Intel is loosing market share to competitors. Thats weird cause it doesn't show. Intel's  full-year revenue set an all-time Intel record of $77.9 billion, up 8 percent YoY.

You said Intel is loosing money an yet For the full year, the company generated a record $35.4 billion cash from operations. That's alot of doll hairs!! Also, nice for share holders since they paid dividends of $5.6 billion.

The problem they had was poor leadership. But their new CEO Pat Gelsinger is top notch. At VMWare, Gelsinger oversaw massive growth. VMWare posted $10.8 billion in 2020 revenue, more than double the $4.6 billion it earned in 2012, the year Gelsinger became CEO. Prior to his role at VMWare Gelsinger spent three decades at Intel, becoming the company's first-ever chief technology officer and helped establish Intel's position as a market leader. Gelsinger also has a technical background — he architected the original 80486 processor at Intel and has associate's, bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering — which has proven helpful to other Intel leaders in the past, as well as competitors like AMD CEO Lisa Su.

Finally, because intel is a massive company they are diversifying beyond their main product line. Over the years they have invested billions in innovative startups targeting cloud and AI infrastructure, edge, 5G, autonomy, cybersecurity, client & gaming, enterprise applications, silicon design & manufacturing, and a wide range of other disruptive technologies.  Thus, they lost focus on their core, but in 2020 the company invested $13.6 billion in research and development and $14.3 billion in capital expenditures while focusing to strengthen its core CPU business. 

Therefore when you look at all those factors intel is under valued and with there new leadership they are hungry to regain their position as number one.

Prior to his role at VMWare Gelsinger spent three decades at Intel, becoming the company's first-ever chief technology officer and helped establish Intel's position as a market leader. Gelsinger also has a technical background — he architected the original 80486 processor at Intel and has associate's, bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering — which has proven helpful to other Intel leaders in the past, as well as competitors like AMD CEO Lisa Su.

Finally, because intel is a massive company they are diversifying beyond their main product line. Over the years they have invested billions in innovative startups targeting cloud and AI infrastructure, edge, 5G, autonomy, cybersecurity, client & gaming, enterprise applications, silicon design & manufacturing, and a wide range of other disruptive technologies.  Thus, they lost focus on their core, but in 2020 the company invested $13.6 billion in research and development and $14.3 billion in capital expenditures while focusing to strengthen its core CPU business. 

Therefore when you look at all those factors intel is under valued and with there new leadership they are hungry to regain their position as number one.

165,AMD," I’m not a CEO of Intel to answer all of that but this is just a fundamental basis. I only did some basic research between Intel and AMD and found that AMD still thinks that Intel is still competitive based on their latest [10-K Report](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/2488/000162828021001185/amd-20201226.htm).

>**Economic and Strategic Risks**  
>  
>***Intel Corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively on a level playing field.***  
>  
>Intel Corporation has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. Intel’s market share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past resulted in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability.  
>  
>Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. As a result of Intel’s position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, networking devices (wired and wireless), non-volatile storage and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards.  
>  
>As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intel’s business practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share and margins; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers, retailers and channel partners; de facto control over industry standards, and heavy influence on PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system (BIOS) suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers and retailers.  
>  
>Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel’s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products.  
>  
>Intel could also take actions that place our discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) at a competitive disadvantage, including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as Nvidia Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information. Also, Intel has announced that it is developing their own high-end discrete GPUs. Intel’s position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphics chipset market, its introduction of competitive new products, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs, and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and lower average selling prices for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us.

188,NIO," Good. Reminder:

As a foreign investor, Chinese law restricts you from outright owning a share or stake in a Chinese company (many of which are state-owned). Enter the VIE structure: a Chinese company establishes a wholly-owned subsidiary (often in the Cayman Islands), which then is the company that is listed on a foreign exchange, allowing foreigners to invest. Foreign investors are not buying a stake in the Chinese company; instead, they are buying a contractual promise that the Chinese company will share its earnings and profits with the Cayman subsidiary, which then will be passed on to the investor.

Now let’s say NIO gets pumped; a lot of foreign money flows into it. The CCP then turns around and says, “Great, NIO has a lot of foreign money, pull the plug on the VIE and nullify the contracts.” Now the Chinese company has all your money, and you likely have no judicial recourse or remedy like you’d have here with a pump-and-dump in the States.

And if you don’t think the CCP would do such a thing, remember, in 1997, they signed a treaty to honor the Hong Kong system until the 2047. They went into Hong Kong via the National Security Law anyway, in breach of the treaty.

218,ICE," It'll be interesting to see. 

Thing is, Tesla is in a near-impossible phase right now of developing highly innovative manufacturing and assembly plants that are vertically integrated. If they can get to the stage where this is copy & paste, then the exponential growth of their company will be explosive. The vast majority of companies fail at this, but Tesla has everything available to them to make it happen. 

I don't know the specifics, but I know Sandy Munro (who specializes in specifically this) said that new startup EV manufacturers have a better shot at competing than the legacy ICE ones. He referenced having to retrofit factories and completely swap out their entire supply chain as issues that will cause bankruptcies and mergers. Not entirely sure how the worldwide battery shortage would fit into all of this...

I still think this is an apples-to-oranges comparison. There was a recent survey done here in Canada where they found more than 70% of Canadians planned on buying an EV as their next car. And 83% of that 70% wanted specifically a Tesla. People want Tesla's. They don't want VW EVs. The Mach-E is imo the only good competitor on the market rn.",NathanGorgeous,57,/r/stocks/comments/mc11i8/the_end_of_teslas_dominance_may_be_closer_than_it/gs1qfsa/,0.036,0.87,0.094,0.8773
219,GAIN," I think what everyone misses when talking about competition for Tesla is that the BEV market was only 2.8% of the entire auto market in 2020. It is forecasted to grow 40-50% every year. Because of this growth, competition is not a threat to Tesla because as there are more cars available, the market grows faster. Tesla is estimated to grow unit sales 60-70% in 2021 and bring on 2 additional factories on top of their existing 2, so 2022 might be another year of really high growth. If Tesla is growing 60-70% while the market is growing 40-50%, then Tesla will GAIN market share, despite “increasing competition”

Anyway, today, Tesla has around 23% of the BEV market. I expect this might increase to around 25% or so and then flat-line or decrease slightly overtime. Either way, I see Tesla owning 20%+ of the BEV market 5 years from now, and the BEV market being around 20% of the global auto market (so Tesla has 4% market share of the global auto market in 2025 and growing quickly over time).",32no,28,/r/stocks/comments/mc11i8/the_end_of_teslas_dominance_may_be_closer_than_it/gs1jn5q/,0.01,0.851,0.139,0.9666

225,ICE," This is article is an example of the saying ""figures never lie, but liars always figure"".

A few key things make this a lot less grim looking for Tesla then the author and others here seem to realize.

* Tesla was flat out never going to retain the 80% market share of the EV market in even the best case scenario. Their competitors would literally have had to make zero EV's for them to do that. Even ARK invest doesn't put their market share above 30% with their ultra bullish projections.

* What matters to Tesla and their bottom line **isn't** the share of the EV market, it's their share of the auto market, which is continuing to rapidly grow even as the percentage of their share of the growing EV market shrinks.

* Just because VW sells more EV's **does not** mean VW is growing. VW and other legacy automakers need to cannibalize their still profitable ICE car segment to shift into EV's, and if they don't then Tesla and others will cannibalize it for them. So don't look at VW's EV sale numbers and think they're automatically growing a ton.

* Europeans are heavily loyal to European automakers, much more so then Americans are to American automakers. And VW's sales of their EV's are almost all concentrated in Europe, their easiest market where the government is pushing more heavily for an EV transition. So of course they're selling well there, and yet Tesla is still selling plenty of EV's in Europe against that tough competition and tough brand loyalty. But VW has yet to offer their successful ID3 in the US. Why? Because imo VW knows their sales will likely be extremely disappointing to investors. A lot of moderately successful EV's in Europe have failed miserably in the US, such as the E-Tron. A lot of European EV's haven't been coming to the US after the E-Tron's complete and utter failure in the US markets.

And I'm not even getting into other areas like software, or how Tesla still has to build more factories to pump up millions of cars a year whereas VW already has a bunch of factories they can just retool.",ShadowLiberal,9,/r/stocks/comments/mc11i8/the_end_of_teslas_dominance_may_be_closer_than_it/gs1p0f6/,0.062,0.786,0.152,0.9888
226,FSD," full disclosure first, I'm probably a tesla bias, and my portfolio is 50% tsla. TLDR at bottom.

I have zero interest to invest in a car company. Car companies are like many other commodity companies, it always runs on high operating cost and limited profit margin. It takes billions to make a factory, renewing/changing a production line cost tens of millions, the business only works if you are able to sell every car you make right away, as cars will depreciate in value as it just sits there.

I wouldn't invest in airlines or restaurant chains, for the same reason. profits are limited and the risks associated with it are too high for its reward.

So why did I invest in tesla? making cars is not a lucrative business, but **transportation** is. Tesla is a disruptive company that literally got a foot in every transportation sector.

Gas- tesla solar/electricity/gambit energy (cheaper in long run, and electricity is hella cheap already)

Insurance - tesla insurance. At places where people can get tesla insurance is literally cheaper than any other insurance.

Driver- auto pilot  /FSD, still in Beta/limited access. I know, I know. Just give it a bit of time.

As other ones here have pointed out, making an electric car is actually vastly different from making a gas car, even though they look the same on the outside. Tesla is making new factories and they are planning to make very good use of vertical integration.

Here's another way to look at it. When google or facebook want you to become a user, they offer it for free, because they can make X number of dollars off of you, by collecting your data to sell, or use ads, etc. Pretty simple concept, my grandmother may not understand this but everyone here can.

Tesla will let you become a usher for 37K at the cheapest, with them making \~30% margin on it, and they will collect your driving data to further improve their FSD neural network, offer even cheaper tesla insurance, and all to just sell those right back to our fat asses.

Remember that scene in the facebook movie, the social network, when the facebook office cheered when they hit 1 million users? tesla got 1 million cars on the road by end of 2020, will have 2 million cars on the road probably 2022 end of Q1.

A lot of the points I made here is very over simplified, as I dont want to turn this in to an essay, and Im also aware of the risk/obstacles they have as well.

I am definitely a tesla fan boy but Im always open to have a friendly debate and hear from tesla bears. Dont want to have rose colored glasses on all the time.

TLDR:  Other companies make cars to sell it on the spot for instant profit, Tesla's cars will make way more $$ and they have tons of operation going on.",pingnpong,2,/r/stocks/comments/mc11i8/the_end_of_teslas_dominance_may_be_closer_than_it/gs2hpsv/,0.017,0.866,0.117,0.9938

Then you look at VW which have superior interior finishes and years more experience in the industry.

245,FSD," Your Tesla and Netflix comparison has some similarities but also many difference from each other.


Similarities:

- They both started and are leaders in their section. Netflix w/ streaming and Tesla w/ EVs.

But that's where the similarities ends. Tesla in the EV space is the same as the other ""legacy"" companies in the streaming space that you mentioned such as Disney and Amazon.

Why? Because Tesla does NOT only do EVs, unlike Netflix where they seem to ONLY do streaming services.

Tesla is in many other spaces just like Disney and Amazon is as well. They do not only focus in only one space. In the auto business, the ""legacy"" ICE companies only focus on making vehicles just like Netflix only focus on their streaming service.

What other services does Tesla provides that legacy ICE companies might not?

Solar (Solar panels & solar roofs):

- Tesla's solar business slowed down because of the Model 3, they had to get their solar workers to help build Model 3s instead of solar. But now they are starting to focus more on the solar business as well with the solar roof expanding into more regions. Once Tesla solar roofs is in every state, and there are many more roofing companies trained to install them, their price will slowly decrease and be much more appealing compared to installing solar panels over existing roofs. But even then if someone does want to do that, Tesla also has one of the best solar panels as well.

Battery storage:

- Texas showed us why we need solar and battery storage. Many businesses are buying huge Mega packs of batteries from Tesla. Residential homeowners are also buying Tesla powerwalls.

Insurance:

- Tesla has their own insurance now, but so far it seems to be only in California. That means their insirance business still has a huge room for growth as it expands to other states and countries where they sell Teslas.

No dealerships:

- Consumer buys directly from Tesla, no middlemen needed to increase prices so they can make their own profits as well, in which every other legacy companies have to deal with and cut into their margins.

No advertisements:

- Tesla spends $0 on advertising. They know that anyone buying an EV will be people who uses the internet. Basically anyone who uses the internet knows what Tesla is. https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/tesla-spent-0-ad-money-per-vehicle-sold-2019-vs-hyundai-2k-lincoln-1-9k-jaguar-1-5k This link shows that some Legacy auto maker spends $1.5-2k per car on advertising. Advertising, dealerships and probably having to license out software such as self driving from companies like Google will all greatly eat into their margins. When Tesla is making EVs at the same price as them, those extra costs that Legacy automakers have to do will allow for Tesla to have an edge on them for competitive pricing while most likely having larger margins.

Factories designed for EVs:

- Legacy auto makers will have to spend a lot of money to convert their ICE making factories into EV factories. Tesla already has 2 more giga factories being built to increase their production. And it seems that everything Tesla makes is getting sold out, so their problem right now is not enough factories.

EV in every category:

- By 2025 Tesla will most likely have their Semis, pick-up trucks and new roadster available. They might also have their cheap ""hatchback"" $25k model by then as well. So far there isn't any other company that has an EV in as much categories that Tesla does.

Self-driving:

- Yes there are some companies working on self-driving as well, like Google Waymo. But they don't make cars, so big legacy companies that aren't working on self-driving will have to license that from other companies like Google or even from Tesla as well. This will eat into their costs, same as having to deal with dealerships.

Data:

- Tesla has collected tons of data. They have many cars in beta FSD testing collecting even more data for them to keep enhancing their FSD.

Superchargers:

- Tesla is basically selling EVs and also their own ""gas station"" as well with superchargers in many locations and only expanding. Have you ever seen a ""Ford"" or a ""GM"" gas station? Cause I have not. 

Which other Legacy auto maker can say that they are also in all that space such as Tesla?",Batboyo,1,/r/stocks/comments/mc11i8/the_end_of_teslas_dominance_may_be_closer_than_it/gs2a8pj/,0.02,0.874,0.107,0.9961

247,TV," It's not to say that Tesla won't be around in 20 years and doing well, but it's issues like this that put the current stock price into perspective. The current market cap is for a company with a completely unopposed, risk-free run at the ev space. 

I get that some of you love Tesla and think any of it's stock under $1000 is a bargain, but the future dominance is not guaranteed. You really need to demand a lower price to make the risk worth it. Lower than $500.

248,ICE," I've been saying this for a long time. Tesla is irrelevant. The move to EVs was coming with or without Tesla. Sure, Tesla can be credited with speeding this process a few years. Eventually Tesla will be bought up by a real car maker such as VW or Toyota and we will get a few models with the brand Toyota Tesla or VW Tesla and that will be their legacy.

Another thing is that EVs are not something ground breaking, it's literally a 100 year old technology. It's not going to change anything about society. It's not even a new market. Just the same old car market just with a different type of engine. So the whole hype around EVs is kind of silly. So now people will sometimes choose a car with an electric motor instead of Internal combustion Engine, so what? It's irrelevant for stocks. The same old car manufacturers will dominate regardless, they don't care if they sell ICE car or EV. Making EVs is a lot easier then ICE. They also require far fewer parts so they will lay off a lot of workers.",IamWithTheDConsNow,1,/r/stocks/comments/mc11i8/the_end_of_teslas_dominance_may_be_closer_than_it/gs3crbg/,0.039,0.932,0.029,0.0044
249,ID," I disagree with the good reputation as a German. They have good marketing and most of the people are buying a Golf or a Polo because they are familiar with them. But there are more reliable and cheaper manufacturers out there. The reputation is based on the biased opinion - but not based on actual results.

The currently released ID.3 is a car in its beta phase. The developed operating system wasn't functional at release and I think there are missing some features. Think about it: A company as big and experienced as VW needs to release its flag ship for EV in a beta status. The Skoda Enyak is better than the ID.3 in nearly every technological aspect and costs the same. Skoda is a doughter company of VW, but it is not VW itself. Skoda delivered the flag ship.

They are currently running (driving?) behind Teslas ideas. They could have the benefit of manufacturing experience and infrastructure - but they failed to use them in the last five years. Imagine this: You are a German and want to buy a EV. You have 50k to spend. If VW was successful, you would look for a VW (or Skoda, Audi or XYZ) because you are familiar with the brand. But instead most Germans are thinking about a Tesla when the consider buying an EV. Not a Polo. Not a Golf. Tesla. 

And that is the main failure of VW. I wouldn't say it is their downfall (VW is way to big), but it is a missed opportunity. Their current strategy is to close the technology gap and to talk dirt about Tesla.",Meldanor,18,/r/stocks/comments/mc11i8/the_end_of_teslas_dominance_may_be_closer_than_it/gs27yk9/,0.074,0.848,0.078,0.2846

The less understood disruption is Telsa’s energy business.  As we transition to EV, no one is pivoting towards the demand that is coming for charging stations.  The government incentives are in place for the SWB (solar wind battery) to be deployed in small home and big grid scale.  Imho,

VW has scale of producing gas and diesel.  It's not easy in their world to perform a 180.  Takes money and time.  They have money, they might be able to accelerate time.  They may make the vehicles, which they are.  They certainly are not at the level of performance that their existing cars are or maybe even what current EVs are from Tesla.  So VW and others like GM, Ford etc are going to do what they do best, push out more sheet metal that looks cool, market/PR everything they can to make it sound like THEIR coolest new car ever...the way of the future.

271,ICE," Getting their house in order will be the expensive part. I don't think it's about the competition with Tesla and Nio to be successful in the EV space.

""Just changing their approach"" would require this...

Selling EVs will be at the expense of selling their of current ICE vehicles. EVs will be money losers for VW for a couple years, and will be canibalizing their profitable ICE vehicles. Double bad. Now add the cost of buying all new machinery and tooling for EVs, then having to write off assets for their ICE vehicles. Double bad. Now consider the dealership model, which I believe will be the largest hurdle to becomes a successful EV business. Dealerships make money from servicing vehicles, not selling them. EVs have minimal maintenance relative to ICE vehicles.

272,ID," Well, the pricing here is not actually true.

ID.3 Pro S Tour 4 (jesus), jacked up with additions to the tits is 215k PLN (Polish Zloty), while Enyaq IV 80 with decent configuration is about 250k.

It's still cheaper, but there's roughly 15% between the two, and the latter is a SUV.

I am a bull on tesla and before I test drove the Model Y I test drove the Mach E. I liked the Mach E. It was a smooth ride good acceleration product felt quality. 

I own ford shares as well and pushing them to succeed. 

Software was abysmal. Changing the heated seats level of temperature was laggy. On top of everything else not feeling smooth in the UI. The front display was bloated with information. Range EPA was laughable. How am I supposed to use the 270mi EPA in the dead of winter? The range will be degraded so far saw videos into the ~200-170 mi per charge range. I can't go anywhere with that. What am I going to do with the fordpass and all the level 2 chargers? Slow charging is a major downside when you have low range per charge. 

Test drove the Model Y and it was far superior in everyway, felt very apple like. Kinda it just works. The minimalist design was easy to get used to. I thought I wouldn't like it. That's why I was looking at getting used model S for the longest time. I wanted stuff up on the dash. The seats were so comfortable it was insane. The center display just felt fluid in everyway and everything felt quality. I'd have to spend more than a half hour to determine build quality vs the ford. The Ford was familiar in build quality that's why I can say so quickly to it's experience. 

All in all I guess it's a matter of opinion. My buddy who came a long with me for both drives agreed that the Tesla was crazy and a whole new experience.

492,PEG," Valuation, man. If you bought Intel in the dot com boom, you'd be massively in the red for decades, even while the company was wildly successful by literally any measure.

Prices matter. These tech companies may someday be successful (maybe), but that alone DEFINITELY doesn't make them good investments.

People had been investing at very high valuations, and many professional managers recently remembered not to gamble on 30x 5-year revenue projections when you could sit on profitable companies at 15x earnings or PEG under 1.5. The value rotation is very real.

Plus, even with the 10 year bond stabilizing, expectations in the bond markets are pointing to long term inflation, favoring value for the foreseeable future. The technical charts are ugly, especially for tech.

If you buy the dip, there's still a good chance you'll be ""right"", but not necessarily in this decade.

Plus, the ""high flyers"" from covid are (as of this week) 1 year off their lows. That means investors have meaningful long term capital gains. Plenty of people would rather sell now with low taxes than sell last month with high taxes, especially during that typical Q1 rebalance for pros.

If you're talking about companies that did well in covid, they might have really tough comparisons coming up when they report, especially if they can't maintain the same growth during opening.

I'm not buying the dip. The dollar is crashing anyway, man. Buy the multinationals that will exceed expectations when their foreign sales turn into lots of sweet sweet American dollars. They don't even need growth to beat the numbers, and you get paid to wait. Take the free money, man.

Not financial advice. Don't sue me and stuff.

Edit: To be clear, I'm NOT anti tech at all! I've been there plenty until Jan/Feb, still in cyber security and chips today, and I'll be back in there more broadly at different valuations - love it!

496,GE," On currency :

American companies report their numbers in US dollars, even when they do parts of their business in other currencies. I'm going to use FAKE numbers/company in an example:

Company XYZ sells a widget for 10 euros, which I'll say is worth $10 also. When XYZ reports, they will report a $10 gain from that transaction.

But - if the dollar goes down 20% on inflation fears (after the transaction), company XYZ will then report $12 of profit from the €10 transaction.

497,PG," On currency :

American companies report their numbers in US dollars, even when they do parts of their business in other currencies. I'm going to use FAKE numbers/company in an example:

Company XYZ sells a widget for 10 euros, which I'll say is worth $10 also. When XYZ reports, they will report a $10 gain from that transaction.

But - if the dollar goes down 20% on inflation fears (after the transaction), company XYZ will then report $12 of profit from the €10 transaction.

>Nuclear is currently our only Carbon Free Fuel Source for Baseload Energy. It doesn't compete with wind and solar. It competes with Coal and Natural Gas to provide the power we need when the wind isn't blowing or the moon is in the sky.


The problem with nuclear is there is no way to turn it ""off"" to save on costs.

With coal and natural gas, if cheaper renewables like wind and solar are cutting into your profits because there is too much power supply, you just burn less coal or burn less gas, then ramp back up when wind and solar can't meet the demand for whatever reason.

But there is no way to turn nuclear fuel rods ""off"".  You can insert control rods to reduce the power output but that that Nuclear fuel is still ""burning"" at the exact same rate.  That makes nuclear power *very* expensive if it's not needed all the time.

I don't know anything about UUUU but I don't think nuclear is ever going to be replace coal or natural gas as the ""staple"" reliable energy source to fill in when needed unless nuclear fuel somehow gets cheaper than coal and natural gas, and that's never going to happen.

All it takes is one lucky terrorist and issues would be off the charts. So the government will most likely regulate them beyond the possibility of profit to make it seem like they tried, when in reality they don't want them.

There is plenty of real estate for wind turbines and even more for solar power. What people should be looking into is the companies that will be creating the battery technology for these renewables.

565,AMD," I fear people will associate current 11th and future 12th Gen performance with the new CEO. Intel has probably just woken up right now and needs to be given time to implement the cultural changes needed to compete with AMDs CPUs. 

Until then, You can buy an Intel CPU. You can’t buy an AMD CPU. You can have all the great tech you want, it means nothing if you can’t buy it. This is because Intel is a much larger company and owns its own fabs in the US and it’s something a lot of people in this sub don’t consider along with Intel being way more diversified in their overall business.

As an AMD CPU owner, there is a lot of potential value in Intel stock outside of a YouTube tech reviewer benchmark. I saw a quote here once saying “AMD is priced for perfection, Intel is priced for mediocrity”.

I believe AMD has to remain perfect to maintain its current value and all Intel has to do is just 1 thing right and they’ll start to rise again. One can make a better CPU but that doesn’t mean both can’t be great companies in the future.

630,AMC,"  **GME Earnings Analysis and What Is Hidden Below Surface of Report -** 

Tried posting this in WSB but couldn't so posting here. My brain is smooth, but managed to livestream the GME call yesterday. Here's my take, not financial advice, and why I remain 💎🖐 (102 shares @ \~280 + 25 buy today @ 145). All figures I show in this can be found directly from GME press release - 

Listened to many earnings calls in my life. Never had an issue with access until today because it was full. CNBC couldn't even get in, and have never seen this before. Tells me many 🦍 like the stock and are doing their own DD on the investment. Wise 🦍.

During a global pandemic that had new cases and deaths rise to new extremes during the reported quarter, GME managed **same store sales increase 6.5%**. I repeat - During a global pandemic that had new cases and deaths rise to new extremes during the reported quarter, GME managed same store sales increase 6.5%. Think back, US alone was posting >200k new cases every day. This caused a loss of over 25% operating days due to forced store closures. To me, a better way to look at this is daily revenue from operations, rather than the whole quarter to adjust for forced shutdowns. In 2019, there were 92 operating days in the quarter. 2019 Rev - $2.194 Billion/92 days = $23.85 Million/operating day. In 2020, assuming 75% operating days, there were 69 days of operation. 2020 Rev - $2.122 Billion/69 days = $30.75 Million/operating day. **Daily same store sales show a 29% increase** looking at it this way. That is stellar growth. Doesn't seem like a dying business to me.

New console purchases were limited due to supply issues from manufacturers, not GME and certainly not because of demand for the consoles. These are sales that will happen, and will be realized in 2021 and beyond.

**E-commerce sales grew 175%**. That is nearly a triple from 2019 levels. This is the future. This is where Ryan Cohen shines. This is where the company is focusing, and why they're bringing in a new COO and CTO. This is amazon level growth a decade ago. This has shorts terrified. Take a look at the articles published on CNBC and other MSM paid for by HF shills after the report. If the report was unbiased, this would be the headline. Instead, it's buried in the middle of each article where it is least likely to get any attention. I posted last week about GME needing to be valued on a revenue multiple like tech companies are, and getting a revenue multiple comparable to RC lead CHWY (\~5.5x TTM revenue) would give GME a $40 billion value, roughly 600/share. 175% grow makes a 5.5x TTM revenue multiple on the stock very realistic. Like I said at the beginning of this post, I have a smooth brain and accidentally deleted that post, but if you're interested in it message me and I'll share. Jefferies today raised GME price target from 15 to 175 based on higher valuation multiple, and I think more upgrades are coming.

**No Q&A**. This is rare, and I've only seen this happen with innovative tech companies, and NEVER with a retailer. Imagine if Macy's decided to not take questions after earnings. This is probably the most important take away I have from the earnings call, as it shows the leadership team has balls and the transformation of GME is well underway. GME should no longer be valued like a retailer as leadership has clearly shifted their mentality away from being a retail stock.

No mention of capital raise. Debt is not an issue (unlike AMC, although they are in a MUCH better position now than the start of the year). Management isn't selling stock at these prices, why would you. There are reports they have an option to potentially sell stock via Jefferies, but again, nothing stated they are planning on issuing more shares.

**Less can be more.** One of the best strategies to use in negotiation can be silence. This call showed me GME leadership is savvy and understands this. At this point in the game, they don't have to rush anything, and the only people demanding answers now at how they are going to achieve the transformation are shorts because the cost to borrow the stock is so high! 🦍 have faith in RC and the GME team. Time is on the side of the 🦍 and after showing off their 💎🖐 have given GME leadership confidence they don't have to show their cards too soon.

TL/DR - Earnings call discussed #'s required by SEC, and very little beyond that. Shorts trying to attack GME on valuation after report as expected.

In 2020, assuming 75% operating days, there were 69 days of operation. 2020 Rev - $2.122 Billion/69 days = $30.75 Million/operating day. **Daily same store sales show a 29% increase** looking at it this way. That is stellar growth. Doesn't seem like a dying business to me.

New console purchases were limited due to supply issues from manufacturers, not GME and certainly not because of demand for the consoles. These are sales that will happen, and will be realized in 2021 and beyond.

**E-commerce sales grew 175%**. That is nearly a triple from 2019 levels. This is the future. This is where Ryan Cohen shines. This is where the company is focusing, and why they're bringing in a new COO and CTO. This is amazon level growth a decade ago. This has shorts terrified. Take a look at the articles published on CNBC and other MSM paid for by HF shills after the report. If the report was unbiased, this would be the headline. Instead, it's buried in the middle of each article where it is least likely to get any attention. I posted last week about GME needing to be valued on a revenue multiple like tech companies are, and getting a revenue multiple comparable to RC lead CHWY (\~5.5x TTM revenue) would give GME a $40 billion value, roughly 600/share. 175% grow makes a 5.5x TTM revenue multiple on the stock very realistic. Like I said at the beginning of this post, I have a smooth brain and accidentally deleted that post, but if you're interested in it message me and I'll share. Jefferies today raised GME price target from 15 to 175 based on higher valuation multiple, and I think more upgrades are coming.

**No Q&A**. This is rare, and I've only seen this happen with innovative tech companies, and NEVER with a retailer. Imagine if Macy's decided to not take questions after earnings. This is probably the most important take away I have from the earnings call, as it shows the leadership team has balls and the transformation of GME is well underway. GME should no longer be valued like a retailer as leadership has clearly shifted their mentality away from being a retail stock.

No mention of capital raise. Debt is not an issue (unlike AMC, although they are in a MUCH better position now than the start of the year). Management isn't selling stock at these prices, why would you. There are reports they have an option to potentially sell stock via Jefferies, but again, nothing stated they are planning on issuing more shares.

**Less can be more.** One of the best strategies to use in negotiation can be silence. This call showed me GME leadership is savvy and understands this. At this point in the game, they don't have to rush anything, and the only people demanding answers now at how they are going to achieve the transformation are shorts because the cost to borrow the stock is so high! 🦍 have faith in RC and the GME team.

Medium - this is where I put PLTR. I don't consider it high risk because it doesn't have much short term downside from where it's at. I'm not concerned about the balance sheet because obviously they can keep their doors open, they have a lot of institutional support, they have an impressive client base, and if they switched out if growth to value mode, they could be profitable in an instant. I just don't see big risk here.

High - ARK funds. These are loaded with what I consider overpriced companies so there's a lot of downside, especially short term (ie this might be a bad entry).

I like a lot of your picks, however I don't consider QQQM to be high risk by any means. QQQM uses the NASDAQ 100, so you are looking at some of the strongest, most solid companies in the US, even though it is skewed towards tech. I would put QQQM in the low risk category, and I would also bet on it beating VTI / VOO.

My picks:

**STOCKS:**

Low Risk: I like your choice of Disney, I'll stay with that one

809,DB," I can only chip in from the perspective of a small business/IT startup. DigitalOcean was my first choice for prototyping our platform, the pricing is very attractive and the management interface very user friendly.

We then chose to employ a managed relational database; mainly due to the more inexpensive pricing of Amazon RDS compared to DO's managed DB offering, we've rolled out our production at AWS. AWS has a vast amount of features but the user interface is a real pain in the beginning.

As other already said the cloud space is very competitive. DO has a good offer that is painless to set up first, the company makes a good overall appearance as a friendly business partner, compared to behemoth/incumbent AWS, and the pricing is attractive.

Something else to consider: we've applied for the Amazon founder's program, where they give startups free credit (depending on the tier, either a lot of credits for 12 months or a smaller amount for 24 months). So for the first year AWS hasn't cost us a penny. I guess this is also a disadvantage of DO, as AWS locks in new companies this way.

Still we are using DO for internal development, as we don't want to rely on just one cloud, and if there is any catastrophic event on the side of AWS we'd be prepared to switch production to DO instantly.

From an investor's perspective I'd have a hard time judging the valuation of DO. Probably revenue and earnings growth over the last years are something to look at.

863,AAPL," I don't know. IME, DD doesn't really amount to much in terms of PE, overvalued, undervalued, etc.  Stocks on good companies can go down for years and stocks on bad companies can go up for years. There's really no way to know, given the manipulation and 1000 other reasons to sell stock. People need money now or just want to put it in something else. Earnings were stellar but ""analysts"" said they'd be mindbogglingly unfathomably fanfuckingtastic so the stock tanks and loses 30% overnight only to be back at new highs three years later.

Sure, you want to make sure that the management isn't fucking up too badly, or worse, it's an all out scam, but other than that, it's all just a best guess about whether the product will continue to sell, whether they'll be able to continue making profits as much as before or better, etc. But who knows.

For some people, it means reading 10-Ks, listening to conference calls, reading reviews, etc. Some people will convince you that you MUST do those things if you want to purchase stocks. For other people, like me, due diligence involves analyzing what analysts say. I pay a service to do my due diligence for me. The only time I spend more than 90 seconds analyzing whether I want to make a stock transaction is if that stock is becoming a significant portion of my portfolio. 

There are two major considerations here. First, know your skill level. If you are not someone who can go toe-to-toe with Wall Street's finest, then maybe you are better off listening to analysts than you are reading 10-ks. Second, portfolio management is more important than DD and is more difficult to master. Nibble your way in, and nibble your way out.

But when that emotion to invest comes from empathy, rather than pure greed/speculation, and you invest with money you’re willing to lose for a chance towards the betterment of millions, it hits differently.

Thankfully I’ve gotten some relief over the years by habituation and retraining of the damaged nerves with medicine and mindfulness.

I see you already took a beating recently and it's possible it goes lower.  That short interest is concerning though, over 15%.  Again, market cap $269 million vs enterprise value $45 million, ouch.  They need a lot of irons in the fire and for a few of them to be favorable to get out of that hole.  Doesn't help that this morning JP Morgan cuts the rating.  If you own very little and believe in it, that's a very long term hold.  Just forget about it. If you think you want to dump it on a run up, write a limit order with a price.  If selling at a loss and you haven't held for 12 months, look at your activity and decide if you want a long term or short term loss and sell based on that.",r-T00Littl3Time,3,/r/stocks/comments/mc2d2e/question_about_biotech_development_and_valuation/gs1e5a1/,0.125,0.795,0.08,-0.7597
911,EFT," It's my understanding that these companies are working on multitudes of applications.  That's why when a single drug shows favorable results that fact moves the stock.  If it's a common problem, it's possible this new drug moves to the best practice and gets prescribed as soon as it's produced.  Take the Alzheimer drug announcement recently moved the drug maker's stock price.  MRNA for example is using their technology to cure or mitigate many ailments.  Here's a list of their pipeline.  Then along came Covid and they dropped everything to take their 10 years of lab work (with $0 revenue) and apply it to this virus.  They came up with a solution remarkably quickly and now they have revenue.  If a booster is involved which I think is part of the game plan, that is a revenue stream for them.  They extrapoluate what that revenue can be.  The stock moves to that pricing based on that and then adjusts based on actaul sales.  [https://www.modernatx.com/pipeline](https://www.modernatx.com/pipeline)

Simply put, they have many irons in the fire and need 1 favorable result to cover other failures.  Take a company like Pfizer.  Their stock price barely moves on vaccine news because they have so many drugs being prescribed as it is.  BioNtech though does move because Covid is a larger % of their revenue than it is for Pfizer.

The holding you've mentioned is working on a depression drug.  It looks like the stock was downgraded in Dec.  Then it was hit with some more anaylist downgrades in Jan & Feb.  That might move the stock down if it had a run up.  And based on new info did the price shoot up and resulting in an overweight position.  Some of these things need to be very long holds.  Like 10 years.  You'll look back and feel you picked a good company working on some good technologies to cure things that ail people around the world.  I hold BioNTech, Pfizer, JnJ, and Mrna.  In addition I own an EFT with a bucket of 64 stocks and it's not one of them. I sold some of the Mrna I think a month ago.  It's fallen off that high but I'm waiting for their results to square up the stock and take the revenue mystery out of play because they'll have to report it, but I'm a hold for the rest.  I don't need to sell any of it for 8-10 years.  If they get a prostate or breast cancer drug going that'll be a good holding for me.

Will say this, in a quick look, #Schwab gives your pick a B rating but what I also look at is enterprise value vs market cap.  The Market Cap is $4.3 Billion and the enterprise value is $2.2 billion.  I like when a business is valued more than by Wall St.  This has a very long way to grow into that market cap.  Short interest 8.9%, not overly terrible but anything above 5% IMP, isn't that great.  Edge 2nd opinion rates it a Avoid.

913,BP," You can use some arbitrary calcucations, as to what they could be worth given they take a % of the market, and divide it by the LOA. However, the stock price is more often than not driven by news hype and general LOA. There are some key indicators however, that increases the likelihood of success imo.

I'm heavily invested into two ""small"" Norwegian phase-2 biotech companies focusing on cancer treatments. My reasoning? Crazy strong **data**, **fast-track** for multiple indications, **orphan drug designation**, funded **partner** trials. From my experience, they often rally on days of positive news, but due to low volume on the small exchange, the stock price will see a steady and slow decline. You always run the risk that something negative can happen, or that there simply is no interest in the product from BP.",sjerkyll,1,/r/stocks/comments/mc2d2e/question_about_biotech_development_and_valuation/gs1ng3a/,0.115,0.805,0.08,-0.743

This is where you’re more likely to find true full body contact competition.

Well the reason is that they think a different Cyber security company will grow faster and gain market share.  Now if the entire market drops for unrelated reason they lose money on the growing company and make money on CHKP, or vice versa.   Either way they are even.  

 The only way they make or lose money is the bet that the growing company will do better relative to CHKP.

A nice rep got back to me in 2 days, he told me they were running behind but that it would eventually transfer and the info finally transferred over after 2 more days.

977,ABC," The way I understand it, and someone please jump in and correct me where I’m wrong: 

Buy 10 shares of ABC for $20 on Feb 1 ($200 investment).

Stock tanks for whatever reason and you sell 5 shares of ABC at $10 on Feb 10 ($50 loss).

You then buy 20 shares of ABC at $5 ($100 investment).

To figure out your cost basis, you would take the  disallowed loss from the wash sale ($50 -because you bought a similar or identical stock within 30 days after selling for a loss) and add it back to your investment then divide by the number of shares you have. 

10 @ $20 : $200
5 @ $10 : $50 disallowed loss
20 @ $5 : $100 + $50 disallowed loss from above = $150

Cost basis becomes 5 shares + 20 shares = 25
shares / $350 (original investment + disallowed loss + latest investment)..... $14 DCA",T4RSR5P84,1,/r/stocks/comments/mbu3j3/wash_sale_question/gs08ipj/,0.081,0.794,0.125,0.5719

979,ABC," The answer to that entirely depends on the purchase/ sale prices. **If your loss is not allowed by IRS**, the loss amount is added to the second purchase and increases your cost basis.

Example:
Dec 1 - buy 100 shares ABC @ 55/per.
Dec 11 - sell 100 shares ABC @ 45/per. Loss of 1000$. This can be claimed as capital losses on your tax return if you don't purchase a similar product within the waiting period. 

Dec 15 - buy 100 shares ABC @ 50/per. *wash sale has occurred*

Your cost basis for this purchase is actually [(100 x 50$) + 1000$]/100 which = 60/per share (Your new cost basis) 

How exactly this impacts your taxes is dependent on too many variables to get into on here. There's tons of resources out there to help you understand this stuff,  just gotta get to reading 😉 talking to a certified tax pro is also a very good idea.",ItsAPanda_Monium,2,/r/stocks/comments/mbu3j3/wash_sale_question/gs0wtf7/,0.061,0.847,0.093,0.624
980,CD," I would not put it in the market if you need it soon and it’s set aside for something specifically, like others have said, if you were wanting to use it in 5-10 years you would have some more risk tolerance.

There isn’t much you can do that is super safe and has much immediate growth to it unfortunately.

985,MP," Fellow MP investor here - The shares are tanking for three reasons:

1)  There appears to be a general rebalancing going on in the market with growth stocks, MP included.  So firms are moving away from the high growth into more conservative investments as Europe shows signs of a pull back due to Covid

2) The recent earnings were really good, but Wallstreet loves to tank stocks after earnings.  They suck.

3)  Your point, the additional offering.   Though this is a private offering to be more precise - it is a dilution of share value, though not a huge one given it is about 10% of their market cap.

The purpose is to generate revenue to grow the business.  Companies that are growing need money, and can get it through IPO (already done), taking out bonds, or offering shares.  This is really good in the long run because it allows them flexibility to build new infrastructure and grow in a healthy way - it just sucks a bit in the short run.",boneywankenobi,2,/r/stocks/comments/mcdi6c/fairly_new_to_the_market_can_someone_explain_to/gs3cs4e/,0.05,0.771,0.179,0.9701
