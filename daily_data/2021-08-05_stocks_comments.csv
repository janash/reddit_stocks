31,RH," Does Robinhood have a moat? What are they doing that's so special? Yeah the fractional shares thing and their approach to trading on margin was novel at the time, but it seems most of the big players offer similar products now. And this is the banking industry, experience and connections matter. RH clearly demonstrated their weakness in this area when they got owned by short sellers earlier this year. Ignoring the mechanics of what happened there, the end result was RH getting a bit of a black eye after the dust settled. And, their CEO's attempt at PR certainly didn't instill confidence that he knows how to handle similar scenarios in the future.

Here's the other thing I don't think most people think about. 15 years ago, you start a new job and set up a 401k, what happens? Go go to the special 401k portal that's tailored to your employer's needs and everything kind of exists in this special, walled off, sort of ecosystem. But, that's not what it's like today. Now, for certain institutions like Fidelity, setting up your 401k eventually leads you into the larger portfolio of product offerings from Fidelity including howtos and guides on ETFs, fractional shares, margin accounts, etc. It's all there.

Is Robinhood's marketing and start-up image enough to differentiate them from the rest of the pack? I'm an educated investor and not really their demo, but certainly the approach Fidelity is taking will pay off over time, no? Having an already established investment account would seem to create inertia that would be hard to overcome. Maybe RH focuses on the small fries -- the folks who are only putting in a few thousand dollars? That would lend itself better to a more mobile app centric sort of approach AKA an almost paypal or Zelle like experience, but then I don't see the justification in the market cap.

Kind of all over the place with this comment, but yeah, what's the angle here for RH? How do they not just become another small player in the somewhat already saturated retail investor space?",deelowe,10,/r/stocks/comments/oyfih9/robinhood_retreats_after_monster_rally_this_week/h7th4ew/,0.065,0.823,0.113,0.9553

50,MMT," I think of how far other sciences have come over the last 100 years for example medicine - it's almost unfathomable the technology and drugs we have today compared to 100 years ago. Even if you look at medicine just 35 years ago, a doctor with just the medical training/knowledge of the late 80s would be wholly unable to practice medicine today. I have to think economics could make similar strides if it hasn't already...why not? Health (like the economy) is unpredictable but we sure know how to treat a vast number of ailments. I also hardly think the economy is more complex than the human body. Sound economic policy should be able to treat recessions (illness) expeditiously.

67,USA," I said I was not an expert so people would not take me for more than I am.  In my view it was better to actually announce that than omit it, or worse, pretend like I actually speak with a high degree of qualification.

Most of my argument is exactly the same as that of William White, who is most certainly an expert and I cited him throughout.

Finally, FWIW, sometimes expert do get it wrong, yes. They got it wrong in 2008. They got it wrong when they outright dismissed the Covid-19 lab leak theory as a conspiracy, being as how that theory is now being seriously investigated again.  The examples are manifold.

As I said in my post, that doesn't mean we should just toss science out.  That would be absolutely ridiculous. Unfortunately, I do believe that some elements of the general public have rightly identified a sort of false certainty and snobbery to today's academia and experts.  You'd be hard pressed to find any of them making a statement like the Einstein one quoted in my OP.

Again, that doesn't mean we should ignore all science and listen to any old idiot.  But there is a middle ground between those two, even if you're 90% leaning towards trusting the leading experts.  That's probably the correct call, but nobody, absolutely nobody has found the truth with 100% certainty, and any serious inquiry should begin with that premise.

As for Brexit, academia and progressives' disdain for the working class directly led to that as well as the election of Donald Trump in the USA.  I think these were horrible solutions in reality, but they were what the working class turned to because truthfully they felt like academia and the ""experts"" were out of touch with the issues facing them.  Populists took advantage of this and made these people think, probably wrongfully, that they were being listened to.  But still.  In their eyes being listened to was better than the alternative, ie being ignored or even mocked.  It's pretty commonly accepted even among progressives that this is what happened, not just some the idiot working class shooting themselves in the foot.  Those who think that way are the definition of academic arrogance and are part of the problem.",shortyafter,2,/r/stocks/comments/oy57s2/the_coming_crisis/h7rs2cz/,0.132,0.764,0.104,-0.8425
68,MSFT," Typically, inflation isn't isolated to cost of living. It carries into equity, bond, commodities, etc markets as well.

Think of it this way. Nearly EVERYTHING in the world is an inflation hedge (not motor vehicles that aren't collector-worthy).

As more $$$ is put into the world, the price of everything rises. You could buy honey today for $1 and in the future it goes for $10.

If MSFT's guidance were to stay the same today as it does in 10 years percentage-wise, would MSFT trade at $286? Probably not, depending on inflation raising its price.

Gold today is around $1,800/oz. Eventually, it'll be worth $5,000 because of inflation.

73,IMO," I'm aware that most people understand (at least superficially) the idea of market risk.  I intended for the message to be deeper.

In my experience with humans, first and foremost with myself, I have found that we have a tendency to hold on to ideas about ourselves and the world that may not necessarily reflect the reality.  That's why some people (not necessarily you) think I'm just some intellectual try-hard when really my only intention was to share something I enjoy talking about and think is important.  Their notion of me (intellectual try-hard) serves their limited world view, but it's not reflective of the reality of what's going on.  If they were open to a conversation with me like you are, they would potentially be able to see how they're wrong about me.

I'm not saying that means they have to agree with me.  It just means that they might be forced to admit that, ""Ok, I don't necessarily agree, but I see where he's coming from"".

The same thing happened with Trump voters, which has been talked about elsewhere in this thread.  Progressives generally thought (and some still think) that Trump voters are just idiots who need to get their act together.  Now, I'm far from a Trump supporter, but the truth is that these people had actual grievances that for some odd reason felt that Trump was going to address better than any of the other options.  The limited, false world view is ""wow they're dumb"".  The more complex, humble view which is reflective of reality is ""well, they may have dumb solutions, but they know their grievances better than I, and they have them for a reason"".

It's the same flawed thinking that tells us ""Wow she's such a bitch"" when maybe she just had a bad day and couldn't hold it in anymore.  Boiling it down to simple terms like ""she's a bitch"" is a closed, overly simplistic view of a phenomenon that's much more complex than that.

The thing is, our closed world view tends to be more comfortable than an open-ended one that is more reflective of reality.  Why? It gives us something to cling to.  As human beings we don't like uncertainty.  It's scary.  It means we know a lot less than we think we do, and are a lot more vulnerable than we think we are.  We could have an aneurysm, we could die in a car crash, the Delta variant or some other disease could cause Covid pt. 2.  It's scary to admit that, so it's much easier to just boil things down to some overly simplistic way of viewing things.

I had my notions challenged at a young age because my life was really on a bad path, and it was either challenge my notions and get humbled, or end up jail or dead or something.  It was that bad (drugs and alcohol related).  Life humbled me.  That's why I'm able to see lack of humility and guardedness in others.

What I see, actually, is lack of humility and closed-mindedness in economic thinkers and the Fed.  And that lack of humility and closed-mindedness are dangerous ingredients that can lead to a crisis, just as they did in 2008.  ""Nobody could have seen it coming"", they said, but truthfully that's just because none of them were really paying attention.  They were too stuck in their own limited and incomplete world view.

Maybe this was the wrong sub for this, but I'm constantly trying to find new platforms to communicate these ideas, and truth be told they permeate all aspects of our culture and society.  So really many forums are appropriate, including this one.  While admittedly the surface level advice of ""be careful and diversify"" may not be all that profound, I think there's a deeper message in here worth considering.  It's sound financial advice, IMO, but also sound life advice.

You may disagree, but these are my honest thoughts, and it's certainly far beyond ""trying to sound smart"" as others have said (again, not you).  Hope this makes sense.",shortyafter,-4,/r/stocks/comments/oy57s2/the_coming_crisis/h7s2dof/,0.143,0.745,0.111,-0.9864

79,GME," Honestly I think much of Bitcoin's value is coming from the uncertainty of the USD rather than from it's own value atm.  I think we're still incredibly early and don't even really have the infrastructure to be what Bitcoin maxxies (which I'm close to but not there yet) think Bitcoin will become.  But with El Salvador making it an official currency I think anyone who isn't buying right now is going to be kicking themselves like every Bitcoiner who eventually buys does.  As I'm upset I didn't buy at $50 when Rogan talked about it on his show back in 2012.  

GME I get, I think the gamble is purely from the regulations and government side though.  The fundamentals of the company are radically different than they were a year ago this time and just the fact that they have no debt, $1.6B in cash and only a $10B market cap should make everyone consider it.  Never mind the short squeeze talk.  

>The way I see it is it's a sad reflection on our society that we have to make these sorts of decisions.

I entered my working life as 08 was happening.  My first full time job I was hired in September of 08, I didn't even fully understand wtf was happening at the time.  You'll notice that both of my plays are pretty much ""Fuck modern banking"" themed, Bitcoin more towards the Fed specifically and GME towards the banks that fucked the economy back then and today.  

If those two things can be destroyed and I came away pennyless, I would see it as a win.  I think the irresponsible printing and Wall Streets gambling is the main reason we went from single incomes supporting a family to basically getting married to avoid needing a roommate.  My fucking boss lives with his parents.  This economy has been shit for the lower middle class and below.  We have almost zero hope of leaving these shitty situations without hitting the lottery.

The excerpt above is confusing and I think there is slight possibility people might be misinterpreting it.  

*Haven't read the quarter yet, so this may be wrong* but I'm reading this differently than I think some are.  I think people are assuming a current top ten customer left the platform after the June outage.  Of course that would be bad.  

But I almost wonder if what he is actually referencing is Tiktok, who left last fall.  That's because throughout 2020 they've always called Tiktok ""a top ten customer"" instead of by name.  This vague language seems familiar.  Also, when Tiktok left, a lot of FSLY corporate messaging was about how they were kind of expecting them to come back, and how they were keeping capacity open for them.  It was a bit weird, almost like a jilted lover.  But anyway, that almost sounds like it would fit with the above statement.

131,FSLY," I can't argue for or against their technology being niche.  It's better, but I suppose your point is valid, that maybe it has features and potential that nobody cares about and isn't using. 

Still haven't read the quarter, but I've seen a lot of the headlines.  They all seem to be saying the same thing as each other (which is sometimes a problem)   But if we assume they're correct, that a major customer switched away during the June outage and hasn't come back, that doesn't speak well to FSLY having some essential or desirable feature.  If a customer can just flip over to some lesser provider and continue life as usual, that's not great.  

And if that *is* what happened, we had a bit of a warning about that a year ago.  Remember back when Donald Trump had a hissy fit after Tiktok users pranked his rally in Tusla or somewhere? They signed up for 800,000 tickets and he made a big show of claiming he was going to have a million people show up.  They built giant grandstands outside the stadium for all these hundreds of thousands of Trump fans.  Actual number of MAGAs who showed up?  6,000.  

He was so angry he claimed Tiktok was a national threat and would be banned... unless they sold the US portion of the company to one of his friends (who ended up being the Walmart family heirs) which is a bizarre way to handle a supposed threat.  Never mind the corrupt nature of that, and the obvious dishonesty of claiming something is a national security threat yet letting it continue to operate.  

The relevant issue is that when he had that tantrum, FSLY shareholders had to estimate how much Tiktok traffic Fastly might lose if the ban were to be imposed.  6%?  12%?  But what nobody knew was that behind the scenes, Tiktok had invoked their own response plan and assumed a US ban was coming, so they cut their FSLY usage 100%, instantly, not even bothering to wait for the ban.  This fact was only learned at the following FSLY quarterly report.  Fastly had some hopeful talk about the traffic coming possibly coming back.  I don't think it has.

There was speculation of how Tiktok could so swiftly and thoroughly dump Fastly.  Had they stolen Fastly's tech?  Was someone else able to copy it?  Some theorized that maybe Fastly's services for Tiktok weren't that special.  In hindsight, that might have been the right theory.  

I still hold the belief that Fastly's technology is vastly superior.  You don't get to be Microsoft, Amazon and Google's provider of choice without having great tech.  

And FSLY's new ""compute at edge"" seems to my superficial eye to be a potential game changer.  I'll butcher this explanation, but it essentially puts little dynamic servers right next to the end users.  Why that matters is it means the web hosts can, in theory, get away with having dramatically fewer servers, dramatically smaller data centers, and less bidirectional traffic.   Letting a customer slash their DC costs is a wicked value proposition.  There's also performance gains, like one example of Fastly's edge compute being able to deliver zero latency Java servers at edge, allowing customers to avoid a 50 ms startup time penalty (and of course running all those troublesome core servers)

Of course if a customer isn't needing or wanting futuristic capabilities, and Cloudflare is able to sell them a simpler and cheaper package, maybe that's what's been happening.",Summebride,3,/r/stocks/comments/oy5d1k/fastly_stock_plunges_19_after_outage_sinks/h7scjzr/,0.142,0.777,0.081,-0.9936
132,FSLY," I've been a strong supporter of Fastly, and to a lesser extent, FSLY the stock.  I kind of still am. 

But even I will say total customer count and enterprise customer counts are a pretty insignificant metric when it comes to Fastly.  They have a shockingly low customer count, but the ones they do have are monster big companies, like Amazon.  Until that changes, you don't want to be measuring them on new customers, because the numbers will be small regardless.  Adding a hundred Joe's Lunch counter customers is meaningless compared to adding 1 Amazon or 1 Target.  What matters is the SIZE of those customers and their traffic.  

Also that talk about customer project delays gives me a pit in my stomach because they keep saying it, quarter after quarter.

176,GM," Unfortunately, that view of the market is incorrect. Your understanding of a zero-sum game is incorrect. Itâ€™s not about there being just one winner, itâ€™s about the fact that the car market is finite in size. This is what the previous poster was alluding to regarding existing car companies struggling to survive against Tesla and new EV makers. The idea that EV sales are going to new customers and that total car sales are magically increasing is completely wrong. The issue is that there are only so many people to buy cars, and car companies are competing over this finite pool. Just because GM say they have X number of vehicles planned by 20XX doesnâ€™t mean theyâ€™ll have sufficient customers by that time to keep their business viable; the longer a company takes to switch to EV, the smaller its market share will be of the car market in the future because the industry is moving to EV. As an example, say today the total car market is 10,000,000 cars a year, and ICE sales make up 95% and EV sales make up 5%. This is where we are today, and GM and other traditional car manufacturers have pretty much their normal market share of the total car market sales and itâ€™s still rosy for everyone (except for the 5% that has already been lost to EV companies but itâ€™s still small enough that itâ€™s not massively disrupting their business). Well, next year comes along and EV sales grab a larger share of the market. Instead of 5% theyâ€™re now at 7% of total car sales, which havenâ€™t moved much from 10,000,000 sales. Yes, total car sales increase over time, however, people should realize that the growth in EV sales is predominantly coming at the expense of ICE sales and is not simply completely additional sales; this is where the finite market comes in to play and why itâ€™s so important to appreciate its impact on the viability of existing car companies. Not all existing car companies will be able to survive the transition; some will inevitably be displaced by the new EV companies. Play this out for 5 years, and itâ€™s easy to see electric sales being around 25% of the total car market. Unless existing car companies are able to sell into the EV portion of the market in meaningful numbers, theyâ€™re going to be experiencing significant declines in sales, which is going to be a huge issue for them. Some will be able to keep trying to survive while others will be forced to give up. Itâ€™s hard to pivot a business that requires billions of dollars in research and development and capital when you have a high debt load and dwindling sales; that right there is a recipe for distress headed towards bankruptcy. When you have companies like Tesla building the facilities it is building globally, and selling the numbers of vehicles itâ€™s selling, as well as the Chinese makers and also the VW group, a lot of existing car companies are simply not going to make the transition because theyâ€™ve lost who to sell cars to. Tesla is aiming at growing its sales 50% a year! That is absolutely huge, and what should be most alarming for existing car manufacturers is that theyâ€™re on track. From being laughed at in 2018, Tesla is nearing a point, if not this year then next, of selling one million vehicles a year, and thatâ€™s with only two factories. 

To use an analogy, imagine a room with 100 people inside. This room represents the existing ICE car market, with the individuals representing the manufacturers. Suddenly an adjoining room appears that is the exact same size, and has the same capacity to hold 100 people. This new room represents the new EV dominated car market. People in the original room look through the door at the new empty room and laugh. Why would anyone want to be in that empty room? Our room is so much better! Thereâ€™s so much activity in this room and everything is going great. Thereâ€™s no point moving over. However, the new room has a second door leading to it from the outside. Slowly, new people start trickling into the new room through this second door, beginning to fill its capacity of 100. People in the original room continue to scoff at and ridicule the new room, laughing at the handful of people in an otherwise empty room. However, people continue to trickle in through the second door into the filling new room. As the number of new people builds in the second room, the life in the room grows, and starts catching the attention of people in the original room; theyâ€™re no longer laughing at the room and the people in it. Theyâ€™re assessing whether that room and the people in it might actually be better than their position in the original room. As theyâ€™re making this assessment, new people are increasingly coming into the new room. Some people from the existing room decide they want to move to the new room and go through the door. The others begin to notice this and start thinking of making the switch too. However, eventually the new room hits its capacity of 100 people and theyâ€™re still stuck in the old room. Thereâ€™s no space for them. In essence, this is what will happen in the car industry over the next decade. Many market viewers doubt if GM (and others) will be able to successfully make it to the new room before its capacity is reached.",dfaen,2,/r/stocks/comments/oy8lja/gms_price_stumble_on_earnings_may_be_a_good/h7sib9r/,0.051,0.837,0.112,0.9962

From being laughed at in 2018, Tesla is nearing a point, if not this year then next, of selling one million vehicles a year, and thatâ€™s with only two factories. 

To use an analogy, imagine a room with 100 people inside. This room represents the existing ICE car market, with the individuals representing the manufacturers. Suddenly an adjoining room appears that is the exact same size, and has the same capacity to hold 100 people. This new room represents the new EV dominated car market. People in the original room look through the door at the new empty room and laugh. Why would anyone want to be in that empty room? Our room is so much better! Thereâ€™s so much activity in this room and everything is going great. Thereâ€™s no point moving over. However, the new room has a second door leading to it from the outside. Slowly, new people start trickling into the new room through this second door, beginning to fill its capacity of 100. People in the original room continue to scoff at and ridicule the new room, laughing at the handful of people in an otherwise empty room. However, people continue to trickle in through the second door into the filling new room. As the number of new people builds in the second room, the life in the room grows, and starts catching the attention of people in the original room; theyâ€™re no longer laughing at the room and the people in it. Theyâ€™re assessing whether that room and the people in it might actually be better than their position in the original room. As theyâ€™re making this assessment, new people are increasingly coming into the new room. Some people from the existing room decide they want to move to the new room and go through the door. The others begin to notice this and start thinking of making the switch too. However, eventually the new room hits its capacity of 100 people and theyâ€™re still stuck in the old room. Thereâ€™s no space for them. In essence, this is what will happen in the car industry over the next decade. Many market viewers doubt if GM (and others) will be able to successfully make it to the new room before its capacity is reached.",dfaen,2,/r/stocks/comments/oy8lja/gms_price_stumble_on_earnings_may_be_a_good/h7sib9r/,0.051,0.837,0.112,0.9962
178,GM, Again I agree with you but I still donâ€™t see the growth potential really. If GM successfully makes the transition to EVâ€™s and maintains roughly their same market share theyâ€™d need to grow profits in order for their valuation to go up.

Yes there will be more than Tesla at the end of the day, but it's more likely Tesla and the chinese EV startups that were built from scratch as an EV only companies with focus on tech and battery production that will survive.

180,GM," Honestly, I like seeing this. I'm just asking the question. If these numbers are true, those are far more acceptable numbers. And well within the average vehicle lifespan. My question for the batteries is even if 98% of a battery can be recycled, what's the incentive to make that happen? Will governments mandate a program? Well manufacturers like GM and Tesla take ownership of their products and recycle batteries on their own? I'm not asking you specifically, I'm just wondering in general.

But the issue of where and how that electricity is generated still remains. If that electricity is coal or gas generated, the environmental load just gets pushed back up the chain to the source. Unless it's from a renewable source (and I know we're getting better much at this, too), there's going to be the same amount of carbon being pumped out. It'll just be more concentrated, which is actually worse.",Garnet034,2,/r/stocks/comments/oy8lja/gms_price_stumble_on_earnings_may_be_a_good/h7tlqna/,0.026,0.859,0.115,0.8514
181,ICE," That's what I'm saying, up until you drive an EV for 10-15 years (depending on the model, of course), the entire system of manufacturing and then driving is net positive relative to an ICE vehicle. An EV certainly becomes environmentally friendly but only after 10-15 years of use. But how many people keep a car for that long? Especially in the current climate of wanting the newest, shiniest thing?

Yes, you can make up a stat for anything, you're right. But, all in, start of manufacturing to the scrap yard, the current generation of EVs are not great. There is currently no plan to decommission or recycle EV batteries. And not to mention where and how most of the world's cobalt and lithium are currently being mined.


But my main question remains: why isn't the general public asking these questions? Why are we not critically looking at what goes into an EV?",Garnet034,1,/r/stocks/comments/oy8lja/gms_price_stumble_on_earnings_may_be_a_good/h7th4l8/,0.045,0.89,0.066,0.3333

190,GM," GM? Thatâ€™s hilarious. Even if you play that out, which simply isnâ€™t possible in any meaningful way, thereâ€™s no way their lineup is going to be profitable. Running two separate assembly lines is a massive financial drag. GM needs ICE sales for capital to develop EV, however, decreasing ICE sales means lower profits per vehicle, which in turn means less capital. This is the fallacy at play here, and why itâ€™s always incredibly hard for an establish business to pivot.

You look into it and calculate that a college degree would take up about 40 hours of your time a week. But then you realize you canâ€™t just stop working at your dead end job because then youâ€™ll lose your income and canâ€™t pay for rent, food, and other bills.

Speaking of which, given that both versions of the Nasdaq have new intraday record highs, while they were flat today, the direction the semis have gone in recently won on determining direction for the Nasdaq.

Edit: While I've made some coin on semis this year, definitely would've been easier for me to just yolo into AMD (or SMH). Because I like to overthink things, I was slow on the trigger on adding to my exposure there.",95Daphne,4,/r/stocks/comments/oye0n5/rstocks_daily_discussion_options_trading_thursday/h7uqd5c/,0.065,0.834,0.102,0.8462

I'm not dumping on AMD, but it took a long time with negative earnings to get where they are today. Intel could turn around too, and have healthy financials to fund a turnaround. I think it comes down to management. They could die slowly, be left behind (but still profitable), or turn around and get back in the driver seat. 2 out of those 3 scenarios easily justify buying at P/E of 12. Might not be a better investment than amd or nvidia though. I don't know the management well enough to make assumptions on probability of improvement.

469,VERY," Then you should go for it.  I've invested long enough to hear every play out there and have not found one that has worked and is reproduceable which is the difference between skill vs. luck.   

Good luck as history and every study out there has shown it is VERY hard to impossible to beat the index over any length of time.  To put it in perspective when Jack Bogle started his now sp500 index fund in 1974 or so he cleverly wrote down every equity fund  out there that existed at the same time.  Think it was 740 or so funds.  These are funds run by the brightest guys, with the most data, at a time when information was not known universal at the same time like now giving some a clear head start, etc... How many beat his index after a mere 25 years?  12 out of 740 or so.  If you subtract a mere 1-2% extra costs due to trading and taxes for active management (which is being VERY conservative) then it came down to 5-6 out of 740+ funds.  So that means in the real world (not theory) the chances of an expert with a ton of money and resources at a time when it should have been much easier then it is now due to disparity of data available had a chance of success of <1%.

Is your assessment of the future that those with largest capital and current engineering investment into future technologies will have a below average or above average chance of being leading players?

Could you transpose your statement, of the risk involved in these companys, to any point in the last 10 years and still be a true statement? If so, then how do you use that as a logical argument against investment?

In the next 20 years every industry is going to be transformed by artificial intelligence. I am a software engineer by primary occupation and can see the writing on the wall plainly.

Also, the world is going to be on fire. If we avoid a sudden tipping point (in which case talk of money and valuation will be for naught), then I would also consider investing in anything technological or otherwise that is well positioned to maintaining basic social fabric. So, that's agricultural supply chain above all but extends to many other domains that we probably take as given right now.

I'm sticking with tech because it is the singular that determines how the next decades play out. In other words, if our AI systems are not sophisticated to deal with the looming conditions of social collapse then no market will have any value whatsoever. The future is AI dependent in a very literal sense. Unsurprisingly the top picks in this thread are among best positioned to continue the trajectory relative to their investment into that vision of the future.",CrabBeanie,1,/r/stocks/comments/oy375p/this_seems_simple_why_are_people_losing_money/h7u50jc/,0.068,0.836,0.097,0.8092
473,AI," I'm not that confident. I just know my predictive capability, and my understanding of the tech sector over decades. I really don't like money very much, and don't want to spend more time thinking about it. To me its value is relative to how much I don't have to think about it. If I had more, I'd have to think of it even less. So that's my motivation here.

I'm not trying to beat the market. I'm trying to get a sense for how people view the market and why they wouldn't pick the way I would have. I understand right now there aren't many in the market learning linear algebra, machine learning, crytpo and blockchain. But some know they should put some money into AI.

I know those things, and can see where the market is going and I think I can reasonably assess which companies are moving towards that most effectively. So I would limit my picks to those very narrow domains. Broadly speaking, I'm thinking of how to produce a low risk outcome with a likely low yield result that is still better than letting my money sit in the bank and lose value. Other than all of that, I really have no interest in the broader system.",CrabBeanie,1,/r/stocks/comments/oy375p/this_seems_simple_why_are_people_losing_money/h7qlu48/,0.087,0.826,0.087,0.4273
