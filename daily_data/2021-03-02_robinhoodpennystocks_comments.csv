44,DD," I did some DD on RYCEY back at $1.48 and decided to buy 50 shares for a strong hold. Here is my basic reasoning: 

- RR is looking to expand their presence in the energy sector, and although they have had some failure, their stock seams to rebound easy from it
- RR is shedding their cost heavy production, looking to a better profit from once loss heavy areas
- A lack of news from them tells me they are working steady through the pandemic where similar companies are failing or having employment problems, showing stability quarter over quarter (unlike Trader Joe’s or Amazon who are having widespread strike issues and union problems)

As there is minimal information during this pandemic on RR, I felt it extra risky to buy, so I started small and I’ve had only positive gains so far!

69,AGTC," AGTC single-handedly keeping me above water. 

Still up on OIIM (not quite a penny stock) but it just seems so volatile. The bid-ask spread is really wide, and one single trade can swing it 10 or 20 cents high or low. I'm bullish on this company as there is and will continue to be huge demands for integrated circuits and chips but I might sell because I'd rather invest in something more stable. This is probably better as a long-term hold.

Averaged up on REI unfortunately, 125 @ 2.37. I think it'll go up but I'm in the red currently.

Breaking even on ZOM, ANTX and TRCH. Only down by a dollar between these 3. I think Walrus' DD will spread for TRCH and it'll go up, ZOM should go up a bit this month then I might sell right before product release assuming the hype increases the price. ANTX was a yolo buy because it's a $12 stock that tanked out of an overreaction to some bad news. Should be a really nice and quick turnaround.

Bought IDEX on a slight dip yesterday so I'm up a few but I might sell @ $4 if it hits that this week.

Still up on OIIM (not quite a penny stock) but it just seems so volatile. The bid-ask spread is really wide, and one single trade can swing it 10 or 20 cents high or low. I'm bullish on this company as there is and will continue to be huge demands for integrated circuits and chips but I might sell because I'd rather invest in something more stable.

I read a few articles, read through the info on their website and threw some $ at it. It is behaving very strangely as I bought shares and it kept going up. That may be a warning sign. I am not used to that type of behavior from a stock so maybe someone can help interpret what that means.

First off - yes it does have FDA approved products which you can find on their website here ([https://www.therapeuticsmd.com/products.php#](https://www.therapeuticsmd.com/products.php#))

Second: As you claim ""dabbling"" has caused you to ""read"" - You need to keep learning/reading; like maybe to look at the company website, 10K, 8k, etc.  So you don't make dumb claims like they don't have FDA approval.  It's a legitimate business (with legitimate products online) and if you are investing in the ""hype"" around stocks rather than finding the value in the stock, than I'm sure you'll make a few dollars but not the kind others will.

Third: As far as your ""advice"", I don't generally take my advice from future gym owners - but if I do, I'll make sure reach out.  In fact, I don't think anyone should give financial advice here - just share your DD and let people decide where to go from here.

Lastly: I do concur that penny stocks should never be invested in with money you need and it should be only be done with money you can afford to lose.  This is fun, and can be profitable.  Which is why I don't understand your original post that you'd rather put it in a savings account to make money from it?

Edit: added Brosefine, to make it more gender neutral, because women can make great gym owners too!

252,HUGE," I'm glad to hear you intention isn't to give financial advice!  I just hope you can understand how comments like "" Right now, buy oil and energy stock..."" and "" Also buy plays in energy storage..."" could sound like advice and could you leave you liable.   Just something to think about going forward, it's hard tell'ing not know'ing.

Well you are absolutely entitled to your opinion.  

For my sake (the 123 shares I still own), the 348 employees, the 312 institutional share holders, the thousands of other stock holders, and thousands of people on their prescriptions - I hope your wrong.....but time will tell on this one bud.  

Since you've shared your opinion I'll share mine: 

It's a legitimate business, thought its the value has been diluted several times.  Hype may have caused a spike, but there are legitimate income earnings and they project to be in the Green in the next 12 months (listen to their earning reports).  Which means, yes - this is a longer term hold.  Biotech companies are NOT normal stock companies, it takes HUGE amounts of money to get each marketable product.  That's why so many biotech companies hit ""penny stock"" status.  It's high risk and hell every company ""could"" tank from it, but (so far) they seem are on a decent path and I'm willing to see where it goes (for a while).  

While I love the thrill of a quick buck, just because I don't get it - I don't think it entitles me (or anyone else) to shit on a stock WITH falsehoods (like the FDA comment).  It causes undue stress - and man honestly after the state of our Country for the last 4 years, I'm just tired of people lying or spewing false shit.  If you get caught trying to justify your opinion with something that wasn't true, just fucking own it - bub - don't double down with other shit.

Saw it was down like the rest of the market (low buy in with hopes of market recovery at least), average price target was a 30% gain, and the EPS chart on the RH app showed them beating the last two. Read the earnings conference call on Friday and everything they said was positive and growth getting them back to pre covid levels. Looked at their 1 year chart andnthry have a spike the week of earnings every time.

399,DD," (basic info: Chinese company [don’t say it I know], massive paper product manufacturers outside of Beijing, started making tons of single use surgical masks back in April [beginning of covid] and are planning on distributing products once they’ve been approved. (Big because Europe and China are starting to only allow single use masks) This will be soon, in my opinion 1-2 month hold until the masks are for certain being distributed. Wanted to know others opinions and DD if they had any.

Edit: the demand for masks is still relevant, even though people think covid is over (it’s not), they’ve been stock piling inventory since April, and once they get approved it’s open season for surgical masks.
