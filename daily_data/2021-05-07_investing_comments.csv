0,UI," Hmmm… maybe, just maybe, everyone who was on unemployment initially after the first round of lockdowns, has had their benefit years expire over the past month or so, and are now only just being re-registered in the system, boosting the numbers. I think the numbers were down because people’s first year of benefits expired so people were kicked off the system, and I’d say the number will go up as more and more people sign up for their second year of unemployment. It took me a full month to get my unemployment re-instated, so I would have been counted as not being on UI the last time they released the numbers.

There’s even more to it than that - it’s 300 additional per week so state benefits + 300.  So for instance let’s say one can go work and make 20/hr. That’s 800 weekly.  Perhaps their current UI is 300 plus the federal addition of 300.  So the question is would you do nothing for 600/wk or work 40 hours for 800?  Is working 40hrs a week actually worth $200?  Not to many, especially the types who work these low income jobs.  


I’ve got clients reporting that front desk workers are asking for $25+/hr, for what was a $12/hr job a year ago.

8,UE," > I fundamentally disagree that it reduces the active labor force in any way. You can be on unemployment without being considered outside of the labor force.

I don't mean it in terms of the official definition, but in the practical way.

For example, someone might be ""looking for work"", but in reality they're telling employers their expected rate is $30 even though the market rate for the position is $15. They know very well that no on is going to hire them at that rate, but they need to apply to jobs to fulfill their weekly unemployment certification process.

>The policies that are in place are there because it's a known fact that during extenuating circumstances (such as a pandemic) chances are more people than normal will be affected than is typical. The more people who are affected, the greater the risk to the economy as a whole. To temporarily shore up against the catastrophic effect of such, those policies are necessary.

Definitely needed to some extent at the start of the pandemic, although the benefits were a bit too high. If the government is going to tell people they're not allowed to work, it's reasonable to have high UE benefits.

With the economy pretty much reopened now though, it's not really needed anymore. The benefits don't expire until September except in a couple states that are opting out.

20,NKLA," I'm a little conflicted by this line of argument. I recommend low-cost indexing to anyone who asks in my personal life, so I definitely support the broader argument here. Further, there are entire subreddits dedicated to [obvious scams](https://old.reddit.com/r/NKLA/) and other pump-and-dumps so there's clearly a need for this type of analysis.

On the other hand, it's so alien to my experience that it comes off to me as unpersuasive. I've probably held 50+ individual stocks in my life and none of them went defunct. Even broadening it to every company I've put on a watchlist, that number is still zero out of 200+ companies. The few delisted were products of M&A, and generally profitable for shareholders.

This article itself shows the numbers are vastly different for large companies, where 77% of the top 1000 companies by market cap made positive returns and just 7% are gone.  Further there's the minefield of Biotech stocks which decay steadily to zero unless they develop a profitable drug. [18 of the 32](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&f=ind_stocksonly,ta_perf_52w75u&ft=3&o=industry) stocks down 75% over the last year come from this one industry - two more are generic drug developers.

Finally, even if stocks were exactly the unavoidable minefield described in this article, it's not a mathematically persuasive argument against active investing. After all, an active strategy could also include direct indexing where an investor owns merely *most* of an index. If owning just a few stocks is bad, then owning all but a few has to be the mirror image, right?

25,IMO," IMO it's going to depend on whether governments regulate them into the ground.

Most of these platforms have profitable gross margins, but lose money due to R&D and marketing expenditures. If they stopped focusing on growth and focus on profitability, they could definitely be profitable. But in the current low interest rate market, it's in their interest to try to grow to dominate the industry.",skilliard7,2,/r/investing/comments/n70yxb/will_business_models_like_doordash_instacart_or/gxal1jn/,0.139,0.597,0.264,0.9194
26,ID," I do think these companies can get to profitability once they get to a certain level of scale. 

The main source of losses for these companies comes from marketing. They have to spend a lot of money up front to acquire merchants, drivers and consumers to create their three-sided marketplace. They can't get one party to buy in without the other two. When gross profit they get on orders is lower what they spend on marketing, they are unprofitable. But once they are known enough and the acquisition cost is lower, that's where their economics is improved. Take Uber for instance. Their Mobility service has been profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis for a while and their Delivery side's loss has gotten smaller and smaller even though the gross bookings increased significantly. That's because they became more efficient in acquiring all the necessary parties. 

In terms of maintaining the stickiness, each one has their own approach. Instacart and Doordash both have an annual membership. Once customers become a paid member on a platform, they will likely be a bit more exclusive to that platform. For Uber, they rely more on their width of services. So you can order rides, food or alcohol. You can have essential stuff & grocery delivered. All on one app. 

All of these three are likely converging in each becoming a transportation-as-a-service company. I think the market is big enough for all three to coexist. 

There are a couple of other factors that can affect profitability. Doordash and Uber already sell ads on their platform. Ads is high margin. So they can make more money there. Uber is starting to let users on their app rent cars from car rental companies. Whatever revenue they get there should also be high margin. Uber acquired Drizly. The way Drizly works may help Uber with their unit economics as well. Merchants have to pay Drizly a monthly fee for access to Drizly's users. Users have to pay a flat fee on each order. Drizly doesn't do delivery services. They just connect end users and liquor sellers, and help them with marketing and ID verification. So margin there should be higher than margin from a delivery service, I think (Drizly is profitable). 

I read somewhere that when working with Instacart, merchants either have to give them a discount so that Instacart lists the same in-store prices on its app or Instacart pumps prices by a certain percentage on its apps. If merchants don't want to look uncompetitive and lose out sales to competitors, they have to give Instacart what it asks for. 

Long answer short, I think these marketplaces can get to profitability. It's challenging, but possible.",minhduong243,1,/r/investing/comments/n70yxb/will_business_models_like_doordash_instacart_or/gxb3yya/,0.053,0.848,0.099,0.9706

39,ICE," Maybe,  but eventually reality gets a vote, that may take a while though.

NY just shut down Indian Point and promises to someday replace it with green wind and solar,  but they haven't built any yet and haven't even started siting the high voltage transmission lines that no one wants near them.  In the meantime they are getting the electricity from nat gas, and that gas is delivered by trucks and trains because they stopped the pipeline. 

Intermittent power is a big limitation when it gets to be a large portion of generation.   I  read a nice paper a few years ago about how North Carolina could go entirely green.   Basically between mountain wind, coastal wind and solar every day of the year had at least one of those available.   That's nice until you stop and think about it.   Every one of those needed to have enough capacity to supply the state by itself (when it was the only one available), but you have 3X capacity when all three are available.   Individual wind/solar may look cheap,  but if you need 3x then it gets more expensive. 

There is a lot of future technology that could if it were real make it realistic to go full wind/solar,  but there's no guarantee and the time frame they are pushing for electrify everything and zero net carbon doesn't make me confident that the new tech will be invented in time.

Add that electrify everything and ban ICE will mean tripling electricity demand. That's a tall order.

I need to look into the growth further.  However, it's concerning to me because they just reached profitability in 2020.  A quick look shows revenue growth could decline from 14% to 10% in the next 2 years.  That's down from 40% just a few years ago.

Their existing network of 15.5 million subscribers does give them a current advantage, and that number has grown on average by 1 million over the past 5 years.  However, I'm not convinced they can hold on to their subscribers with all of the other options out there.

The healthcare sector is characterized by massive bureaucracy and opportunities for growth. It is one of the rare sectors where real future growth is possible by innovation. Microsoft has established itself as a corporate and industry suite, but now it seems that they are taking their whole Eco-system and moving on the healthcare industry.

This is pure speculation, but it can be one of the boldest moves yet, as healthcare facilities, operations, education, training, quality control are large complex systems that can benefit from the tools and services that the company offers.

We have seen Microsoft positioning for a certain client type and taking over most of their business. As the opportunities for growth in the corporate sector decrease, Microsoft might just turn to one of the most complex industries with high barriers to entry and large upfront investment costs.

On 11 April 2021 they entered into an agreement to acquire Nuance Communications for $ 56 per share, or $19.7 Billion. Nuance is a cloud and artificial intelligence (“AI”) software provider with healthcare and enterprise AI experience, and the acquisition will build on our industry-specific cloud offerings. This is effectively their foot in the door to the healthcare industry.

""Trucking demand began surging last summer as the U.S. economy started to emerge from lockdowns put in place to slow the spread of the coronavirus, and as retailers and manufacturers rushed to restock pandemic-depleted inventories. Transport demand built up additional steam into the holidays as bottlenecks at busy ports led to freight backlogs, and it hasn’t let up since.

Analysts expect shipping volumes to stay strong as the economy kicks into higher gear on new government pandemic aid and increased Covid-19 vaccination rates. That will put pressure on freight pricing as shippers compete for a limited supply of available trucks, and carriers boost pay and bonuses in an effort to meet the demand.

“In our view, this is the tightest driver market we have seen in our nearly three decades of being involved in the trucking sector,” Cowen & Co. transport analyst Jason Seidl wrote in an April 12 research note.""

On the other hand, shippers are dealing with high rates, tight capacity and disrupted supply chains.”

Manufacturers and retailers including General Mills Inc., Rubbermaid-owner Newell Brands Inc. and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. have pointed in recent quarterly earnings reports to rising transport costs and tight capacity as operational hurdles as they seek to restock inventories and meet strong consumer demand.

86,USA," Hello,

Novice investor here, USA, 20s, 35k income, time horizon 10++ years, moderate risk tolerance (more gains than treasuries (/bonds?), but aiming to limit loss to -25%). I don't have a specific financial objective at this time but capital preservation / limiting losses is important to me. 

I've 'learned' a lot of new investing terms in the past few weeks, I'm probably not using them right yet, please bear with me. I found an interesting ETF called Global X's ""Adaptive U.S. Risk Management ETF"" ($ONOF) and wanted to know if it might be a good fit for me. 

With my basic understanding of the prospectus, it seems this $ONOF would do well when there are market is bullish or bearish for extended periods of time, but will perform poorly if the US market is stable/neutral/sideways (not sure what term to use) and market volatility is increased. It appeals to me as I want more gains than treasuries have to offer, but also want to preserve capital gains while still benefiting from following a broad market index such as SP500. I also just like that it's not a typical ETF and has a passive yet algorithmic formula to how it handles its securities (*the only other one I know of is $ASPY which I have not yet mentally prepared myself to fully understand it*).

The one concern I have with this fund is that I will not be using a tax-deferred account and am unsure how significantly the taxes resulting from its potentially high turnover ratio will impact gains. On investopedia, I read the basics on turnover ratio and how it relates to capital gain taxes. Given that this is a new fund, there isn't any data on its turnover ratio currently. I'm not sure where to go from here - I don't know how I could best estimate the impact of the turnover rate if for example it was 300% during an extended sideways market scenario.

Any comments or critique would be greatly appreciated. I hope that you all have a wonderful Friday

91,USA," Question: DCA v. Lump in volatile market

I made what has turned out to be an unfortunate, fear/anxiety/panic based decision in March 2020 to move the majority of my 401K/IRA retirement investments into very conservative funds (MMF/stable-value) on the expectation that there would be a further move down - or at least that there was more downside risk than upside potential. A lot of life happened, I had a rough year, and I literally ignored the investments until a couple weeks ago. After getting past the regret this week, I reallocated a portion of those investments into a still conservative mix of index funds and directed ongoing payroll investments into the same. I currently have 2/3 of my approx. $300K total in those very conservative funds. I have another $125K in cash as emergency fund and for potential 10% downpayment on a house in a HCOL area.

I've read that DCA investing beats trying to buy-the-dip. That's the general rule.

My question is whether that applies in my specific scenario or if it applies more in normal market conditions - i.e., pre-2020. In my estimation, with the market at an all time high, there appears to be more downside risk than upside potential over the next few months to balance of year in the US index-based funds I'd be likely to buy into. My thinking right now is that I don't want to buy back in at what feels like the end of an overheated surge and would rather give up a few percentage points in appreciation than risk losing 10, 25, or more % in what seems like an inevitable correction. I'm 25 yrs from retirement but still don't want to be foolish and compound the mistakes already made.

Am I crazy and just doubling down on a bad bet by keeping those funds protected and out of the market a while longer? Or is it prudent at this point to continue to sit out until a decent opportunity comes along? Or should I do something in the middle and DCA weekly/monthly until it is all back in....

I believe, COVID lockdowns have massively changed attitudes in important markets.

* Two years ago, it was completely normal for a store in Germany to only accept cash as customers didn't really need it to take cards. Now, everyone orders online and pays with CCs. While the growth will slow down a bit, we'll most likely still see faster growth in previously [cash-heavy](https://merchantmachine.co.uk/most-reliant-on-cash/) countries.
* After two years, even technologically challenged people were forced to adapt and recognize the benefits of shopping online. Even my mother, who's in her 60s, lives in Eastern Europe, and couldn't turn on a power bank with a single button, now orders 90% percent of her purchases from the local online stores. Without COVID Amazon had zero chance to sell to this kind of people.

> AWS - there are more competitors and many business are not so fond of paying to Amazon much more than what they are currently paying, I'm estimating possible growth of 10% Y2Y in the next 5 years.

* There's basically one competitor, Azure, which still has a long way to go to match AWS.
* Companies don't want to rely on Google as they are known to kill their commercial products on short notice without providing a replacement. This is reflected by their market share of about 5%, even though they've launched in 2008, two years before Azure.
* The rest are not even close. They may provide VMs / containers / storage, but they don't have the technology that makes the cloud migration to be worth it(like [Amazon Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend)).

There is a possibility of drone deliveries within the next few years. While this one sounds a little more futuristic, the market is forward-looking.

As for Tesla, it is not just a automaker but also a data company. Every Tesla collects data through the cameras on their cars. That means every time a Tesla is on the road, they are collect driver and road info. Data is the new oil in this era. It is to the point where Tesla is centuries ahead of this than any competition. When all the legacy carmakers start developing autonomous vehicles they will have to buy that road info from Tesla. So Tesla is also a data company. There is also talks that Tesla have the capabilities to launch their own ride-hailing app (possibly with autonomous vehicles).

The fact that you think PE of 22 and 39 are good shows the issue at play here. The average P/E for the S&P 500 has historically ranged from 13 to 15. 

Yes, you'll be able to find deals on undervalued stocks right now - loads of them. Value stocks are now getting overbought though.

It's early stages of panic right now - first the high risk shit like SPACs get dumped and money goes to small cap/growth, them growth/small cap get dumped (as they just were).

If the sell off continues, large and mega caps get dumped as people exit the market completely or hedge their cash in bonds and commodities.

And don't forget a lot of people are getting back to real life. That costs money. Money they put on the market during Covid because they had nothing to do with it. There's lots to do now. 

So, if you save $1 on share price of a stock that plummets $10, did you get a good price?

>When someone asks “who owns computer computer game x” both you and the other person will put up their hand.

The broker does. If you check individual share holder for AAPL I think the number was around 260k. This is by far not reality and the reason is all people on most brokers only count as the broker, they are not listed individually and the broker owns the share (on paper). The broker can, depending on his TOS, also borrow your shares to someone else without asking you. Other brokers who don't do that will write you a mail and ask you if you are up to borrowing your shares for a certain fee you receive.
