1,DD,"  Hey everyone! I built a site that tracks all types of trends across reddit (mentions, comment volume, bullish sentiment, etc.). I know there‚Äôs a couple other sites out there with similar functionalities so I won‚Äôt go into this aspect too much (list of features at bottom).

Another big inconvenience I wanted to address was finding good bull/bear cases. A lot of subreddits and posts end up being echo chambers where only one viewpoint bubbles to the top so it‚Äôs hard to get unbiased opinions. Also, some of the best DD can be found nested in the comments, and those can be hard to weed out. That‚Äôs why I added the ability to filter for analysis (in posts and comments) by financial sentiment (bull/bear) to help you find opinions from both sides of the spectrum. The term ‚Äúanalysis‚Äù encompasses things like DD, company/fundamental analysis, news, etc. This tool can be found on the ‚ÄúTicker View‚Äù Page under the ‚ÄúAnalysis Screener‚Äù tab.

Here‚Äôs a brief list of features:

* Chart with mentions/sentiment/price data over time for a particular ticker
* Reddit post feed filterable by ticker, subreddit, and flair
* Analysis Bias screener allowing you to sort analysis (DD, company analysis, news, etc.)
* News/financial data feed for a selected ticker
* Graph showing the most popular (mentions/sentiment/score) tickers over different time frames
* Sortable table for trends on the ‚ÄúOverall Trends‚Äù page, where you can see the top 50 tickers sorted by mentions, mentions change, sentiment, sentiment change, etc.
* Price Action Filtering page, allowing you to discover tickers based on price changes, combined with trend data (for example, if you wanted to see which tickers dropped 50% in price over a week that are above a certain popularity threshold)

Note that financial sentiment may not be as accurate for non-analysis posts, as it‚Äôs harder to pinpoint a positive/negative viewpoint for less research-based posts. Also, posts that have bullish and bearish sentiment may be classified incorrectly. Obviously, the model doesn‚Äôt perform perfectly.

TLDR - Made a site that tracks ticker trends/sentiment throughout reddit and helps you filter bullish/bearish analysis for unbiased viewpoints.

4,AGTC," >""We are excited to present these preclinical results for OTO-825 that build on our previous presentations demonstrating gene expression in support cells of the cochlear, which are the target cells for GJB2 gene therapy, using novel AAV vectors identified through our collaboration with AGTC,‚Äù said Alan C. Foster, Ph.D., chief scientific officer of Otonomy. ‚ÄúBased on these **encouraging results that demonstrate hearing recovery and improved cochlear morphology following OTO-825 administration**, the companies have initiated IND-enabling activities and look forward to providing additional details of the program in the next several months.‚Äù

>The oral presentation entitled ‚ÄúAAV-mediated GJB2 gene therapy rescues hearing loss and cochlear damage in a mouse model of congenital hearing loss caused by conditional **Connexin26** knockout‚Äù by Mathur et al., will be presented on May 13 at 6:30 p.m. EDT.

Had to look up Connexin26, this seems like great news.  Definition below:

Connexin 26 (Cx26) is a protein found on the (GJB2) gene and is the most common cause of congenital sensorineural hearing loss. Connexin 26 mutations are responsible for at least 20% of all genetic hearing loss and 10% of all childhood hearing loss. Sensorineural Definition: (of hearing loss) caused by a lesion or disease of the inner ear or the auditory nerve.

Hoping this pops to minimum $5.75 to $6.  The news is not even close to priced in but probably will be by the end of next week.  And just as small-caps are coming back as well.
