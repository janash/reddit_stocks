0,SPRT," I, too, have developed a huge interest in SPRT. I was collecting the numbers on holdings yesterday and this is what I came up with:

Currently trading at <$4/share. There is a total of 24.1 million shares outstanding. The float is 15.1m shares. 

There are about 30 institutions that hold, combined, 49.54% of the total shares. There are 22 mutual funds that hold 5.2% of the total shares. Insiders hold about 37.35% of all shares. 

This leaves us with 1,906,310 shares (7.91% of total shares) that are *not* owned by insiders, mutual funds, or institutions. 

That's an extremely small number of shares! And it's pretty safe to assume that all of those shares are owned by individual investors, because it would only take 953 people owning 2000 shares each to buy up those shares. I have more than 2000 shares and I'm the smallest of small-fry investors. Which means that the volume of trades that are made on the daily likely consist entirely of the synthetic shares that were created by those short positions. All we need is a bit of a buying frenzy and this thing will explode.",alpha_mu,24,/r/pennystocks/comments/o6aazh/utilization_of_sprt_at_97/h2rfboe/,0.011,0.772,0.218,0.9885

13,EH," I don't like this company at all. Let me explain.

The deal that you get as a share holder of SPRT, isn't that great from a valuation standpoint. From: [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210322005353/en/Bitcoin-Miner-Greenidge-Generation-Holdings-Inc.-and-Support.com-Inc.-Nasdaq-SPRT-Announce-Merger-Agreement](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210322005353/en/Bitcoin-Miner-Greenidge-Generation-Holdings-Inc.-and-Support.com-Inc.-Nasdaq-SPRT-Announce-Merger-Agreement)

It highlighted that Greenidge Generation Holdings Inc is trading 3% of their company for 33 million dollars in cash, which puts them at a valuation of 1.1B. The company only has a Hashrate of 1.1 exahash per second (“EH/s”), and is expected to grow to 2.6 EH/s in 2022. This is in comparison to the valuation of MARA at 2.72B, and with a hash rate of 10.36 EH/s once all their miners are fully deployed in 2022 iirc.

Source:[https://ir.marathondh.com/company-information](https://ir.marathondh.com/company-information)

Why does this company with a projected hash rate of less than 4 times that of MARA have a significantly higher valuation per hash rate than it, you are getting less bang for your buck if that's the case.

From what I see, as a SPRT stock holder, you aren't getting good value, the ones who are coming on top are stock holders of Greenidge Holdings. But that's just my take.

16,DD," Actually this is not true. 3% for 30M but another 5% for the operating and stuff. So, the deal is 8%.

Also I went through all of the CURRENT data and the real hashrate, revenue and especially the mining costs and compared them here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/o0l0ra/i\_compared\_sprt\_with\_its\_two\_main\_competitors/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/o0l0ra/i_compared_sprt_with_its_two_main_competitors/) Greenidge creates more bitcoin, can produce them cheaper, and makes the most money.

Greenidge is also not only a miner, but is running its own power plant which is also completely 100% green and carbon neutral. This not only gets them the lowest energy cost to produce bitcoins, but its also ahead of the discussion if and when mining will become green.

The current stock price btw is not even enough to just price support.com. Just support alone has assets and cash of 70M USD right at hand.

25,SPRT," I see the merger deal as an option for SPRT's stockholders. They can still decide whether they want the deal or not. If the deal is good for them, they will agree, if it is not, they will not agree. An option for SPRT's stockholders has value - so if, as you say, the deal falls through, it will fall through because SPRT's shareholders have decided that that's the best thing for them.

On the other hand, until the merger has not completely gone through yet, you also have the option that Greenidge might increase their offer so that they can convince more of SPRT's shareholders to vote for the merger.

TRCH is a shell company, this isn't news. It's just there, selling all of it's assets (which is where your dividend is going to come from), to put MMATF onto the nasdaq (under MMAT).

On top of the dividend, if you were in early enough to be eligible for it, your shares will be converted to MMAT shares post merger at a rate of 1:1.

As far as ""tricking people"" and ""burning shorts"", there's no trick. Shorts will be margin called before the merger goes through. It's not speculation, it's not something said to trick you, it's a fact. How high the stock spikes is gonna be based on how many short positions need to be covered.

I'm sorry if you bought this at $9 and sold for $6, not only losing 30% of your investment, but also your right to any preferred shares. Selling is not the play, I said that the other day.

190,HPE, I have 4.5 million shares and have had for four years. I am long on this stock and still a believer that wave energy generation can be a game changer for the world’s energy needs. Carnegie has hundreds of patents so if they find the right partner the sky is the limit. HPE definitely has deep pockets. But would need someone like GE or Siemens to jump on board.,Art-of-Intuition,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/o62loj/recommend_buying_carnegie_clean_energy_cwgyf_on/h2q0nr2/,0.0,0.86,0.14,0.7783
191,HPE," Agreed with everything you mentioned and wave energy will be challenging; however; Albert Einstein came up with idea for photons and solar cells in 1905 took Bell labs until 1954 to create the first solar cell and another 40-50 years for solar energy to become affordable and viable on mass scale. With time wave and tidal energy will become affordable and feasible, there is just too much energy potential for it not too happen. With Carnegie’s 20 + years of experience working on trying to address the challenges you mentioned and hundreds of patents and intellectual property it could be well positioned to meet the need. The big if is if they find the right partner with deep pockets and engineering expertise to make it happen. HPE is a huge step in the right direction.",Art-of-Intuition,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/o62loj/recommend_buying_carnegie_clean_energy_cwgyf_on/h2srczb/,0.0,0.84,0.16,0.9531
192,DD," I find it odd you straight out ignored some of the rebuttals you mentioned all of this in on the other DD post, then decided to make a post with the information anyways. A true bearish thesis would've at least included said rebuttal points and proved them wrong.

193,DD," Thanks for this hype check post.

Like a total amateur, I bought a small stack of SPRT at 4.20 because the original DD looked pretty solid (admittingly it was also against my typical aversion to anything related to crypto production), but the more I'm now learning about SPRT's situation the more pessimistic I am about the company.

Personally, my plan for SPRT is that if it goes above my cost basis, I'm getting out, I don't care about any profits I miss out on. There are better places for me to put my money, so also getting out if it steps below 30% of my cost basis.",mythrilcrafter,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/o68tlz/bear_case_for_sprt_support_inc/h2rm6dh/,0.094,0.766,0.14,0.5375

195,GRA," ZEN Graphene Solutions is their name. Based in Guelph ON. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pocV0wKzEw) does a good overview of what Graphene is and why it has so many applications.   
  
Graphene is considered a ""wonder"" material for its ability to enhance other materials such as concrete, plastics and glass with relative ease.  
  
ZEN has been working with Canadian universities such as McMaster University, University of Guelph, UBC and University of Toronto to find commercially viable uses for Graphene.  
  
Wild variation in IP is because the applications are more diverse than this company can utilize;  
Companies such as GMG.vn, GRA.vn, NANO.to DTPKF and many more look to either supply Graphene or find novel applications for the material.  
  
I believe the industry will mature very nicely this decade. Graphene is of course being used as a buzzword specifically because of its properties, and many sell graphite posing it as graphene. Most popular usage of graphene is in the form of Graphene Oxide which is significantly easier to handle than graphene.  
  
Let me know what you think, I've been watching this company specifically for the past few months because Health Canada got involved back in April and lowered the share price significantly.",legoman102040,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/o5x2pp/zgs_business_case/h2s40cu/,0.007,0.869,0.124,0.9694

See: rule #3 and rule #8

Also nice job commenting and upvoting with all your alts.

Also also, your stock is a bloated bitch with over 6.5 BILLION shares outstanding. It's also a dark/defunct ticker with a stop sign on OTC markets.
