33,GME," Completely avoiding any nefarious price manipulation or collusive motivation stuff, my question is why were completely private entities able to kill and preempt trades simply to avoid operating at a loss for a little while or running out of immediate cash on hand? That was their mistake to put themselves into such a situation making a market for GME. If the powers won’t honor their obligations, or more importantly can decide not to because it isn’t profitable, that is a fundamentally broken market. Far more broken than letting any one part fail would realize.

The decision and fallout from it is extremely damaging to future faith in the continued functioning of the market.

You could say avoiding panic and disturbing that faith is exactly what they were trying to avoid, but I’d argue this has been even worse. I don’t really buy the existential threat to the wider market argument anyway. Many trillions of dollars race through these places every day. You’re telling me they couldn’t manage the risk on a company suddenly worth a few tens of billions?? Sounds far more like some entity just didn’t want to get left being the one on the hook. Do you really want to trade in a market where fear of a loss can cause one side of transactions from a select population of traders to get axed? That’s a pretty fucked up marketplace. 

This has certainly done a lot of damage to the perceptions of the options markets and people’s ability to rely on being able to execute their contracts as their counterpart is supposed to be contractually obligated to honor.

In the end, the intent doesn’t really matter as far as congress is concerned (whether or not a crime took place is for the courts). Price was artificially disturbed, losses were shifted between trading populations, no matter how you look at it.

You’re saying nobody had enough capital to fulfill the collateral requirements for trades surrounding a company valued ***only*** in the tens of billions?

Far more volume transacts in far higher priced stocks every day and nobody bats an eye let alone shuts out only the buy-side orders of a select population from their order book.

Either the clearing house fucked up or the broker fucked up, but somebody made a bad (and potentially greedy) call from the perspective of a fair and orderly market. Very likely violating and failing to serve their obligations (even just their execution obligations to route orders elsewhere. How could a broker make a BestEx claim if they won’t actively route) either in some skirted way or directly. Either way, it needs dug into to prevent it from happening again.

Are you saying that the brokers bought on margin? I doubt it, but I ask because people with cash accounts were also restricted on buying the stock. 

In any case, why did the clearing house suddenly ask for (IIRC from Webull's CEO's explanation) 100% collateral up from 1-2%? It seems to heavily suggest that the clearing house was trying to protect itself by forcing their brokerages to prevent investors from buying the stock because they knew going from 1-2% to 100% is an enormous raise that the brokerages wouldn't be able to afford.

Note your broker is far more concerned about covering their own butts from potential losses than anything having to do with your account. Also note the whole reason GME broke the market was because of shorters getting squeezed, so apparently the high short float currently is due to people shorting at the top.

Another piece of the drama were the dealers. Stock get their prices from dealers who post what they'll pay (the bid) and another price a fraction of a penny higher what they'll sell for (the ask) and make money from the bid-ask spread by trading  really fast with supercomputers.

59,AMD," Mine looks like this but upside down. I was up a whopping 3 percent from February to June discovered options and went to 7% and then went to 10% went down 23% due to rona  and now I'm up over 140% over this last year. Even though I had points where I was down most stock I've ever sold I sold at a profit. I'm the kind of person who will hold a stock till profit or bust most of the time. I literally only buy stock in companies I like unless I'm making a short term play. 

At the start I made the mistake of buying stocks and companies I liked when they were already too high so they were going up but not as much as I wanted. 

My first option I bought when AMD was down but I saw how good the Ryzen 3 series of processors were so I did a call for 30.5 when it was like 25 a share  and went from 3% profit down to 24% loss while holding the contract but it was printing hard before expiration. when I sold it brought my portfolio up to the 10%",Snoo43610,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljsu04/can_anyone_guess_when_i_discovered_options_trading/gngignb/,0.038,0.798,0.164,0.979

84,GME," man - this is the main problem.  That and PDT problems

Most people getting into options don't have a lot to trade (that was me a month ago).

I was forced to go into OTM option plays because they were cheaper.  That was strike number 1.  Strike number 2 was knowing i should get out on 'x' day - but having too many trades and having to hold 2 days to not get flagged as PDT.

Now that I put more than 25k in my account, i keep winning - because i can sell whenever i want and get back in.  

My only advice for options traders --- put 25k in your account.  If you can't play with that much, don't trade options.

For years, I was adamant about not losing money in options and to only bet what I could lose - keeping my account balance low. 

I could never win like that.  Thanks to GME my account blew up finally - and Its so much easier.

120,PLTR, I have been conservatively investing since one year. Started trading actively since nov & went full retard since dec. Most of the loss u see comes from PLTR calls &  SPY call debit spreads (weeklies) . PLTR set me back by 2-3K. I was making progress after that tbh. I wanted to recover quickly because  I also wanted to focus on my academics.

132,AAPL," I just check the total percentage up on my options. Once it hits a particular percentage, I sell 'x' number of contracts depending upon the total upside I see in the share price.

Eg: I played Apple during the ER run up and sold my calls at 50%, 75%, 100% and around 125%. The share price reached $140 and the earning was on next Tuesday. I had decided before hand to sell all the calls once AAPL reaches $140 and before earnings. The share price went up to $142 but came crashing down hard after ER.

The important thing to do is once you are out of a particular stock play, never look at it again for a while. If it keeps on going up, FOMO sets in and we try to extract even more profit. Doing so ends up in loss more than often.

RH does not want to extend you $39,200 in margin even if the investment is ""theoretically"" extremely safe. If the shares were to tank after hours or pre-market next monday robin hood would be potentially on the hook. Easier to just tell people ahead of time that they'll close out positions before it can get to that.

If you're holding your options to expiration without cash to cover execution it's on you if you lose the last 30 minutes of profit or loss, that's pretty reasonable.

E: I'm pretty sure they'll even let you use margin to cover, but you still need at least $39,200 in margin to cover a single 392 call. I'm pretty sure RH only offers 1 to 1 margin so they can always liquidate your position to cover if necessary.

If I'm wrong about there being a reason for restricting options trading in the last 30 minutes, maybe you could push for them to give you a checkbox that says yes I will either sell them in the 30 minutes before expiration or watch them expire worthless regardless of how much it costs me.

The question is why don't they allow you trade options for the last half hour before expiration.

If that has a legitimate answer then not selling your option for you in the last half hour means forcing it to expire worthless unless you can cover execution.

The person or entity (perhaps Reddit) who created the mark would need to offer services or good with the mark to make it registrable. Offering the forum in association with the mark would be considered a service that Reddit offers. But Reddit very likely didn’t come up with the trademark(s) for WSB. So to answer your question, if you came up with a new sub and a trademark (like the WSB name and/or boy), you wouldn’t be able to trademark those names/images for forum services because it was actually Reddit providing the service.

My assumption for the current situation is that we sign over rights to ownership to generated IP for the site since they had their attorney file for new trademarks.

227,MVIS," Holy fuck, this is love at first sight. I am in the business of making films and interacting story telling. I play with motion cap and unreal engine as well. I really wish to see this on cameras and all sort of devices. 

I have been using the Lidar sensor on the iPhone 12+ ultra whatever. And even though the results doesn’t fully satisfy me at this moment, I can say I have a strong vision of all the things I would be able to do once the next generation of devises start integrating this technology. And I am looking forward to see what is going to be of the apple VR headset (4000$). 

Why am I talking about apple? Because like PLTR, nobody knows what BB does. And even though they are solid companies, they can’t cautívate the everyday masses like new exiting devises. 

Lasers are the future. I am very impressed with MVIS demos. The volumetric detail is astonishing (being able to see water through the sensors was shocking for me). Pairing this with accelerometers and gyroscope data, will open so many doors. 

I’m going to jump in and start selling cover calls. See you guys in the other side.

I hired him for $150 and he said he runs a hedge fund in India and owned 95% percent of it, I asked him how much capital he works with, and he said... a big number, idk if he wants me to disclose that. More than DFV has. This is apparently his website https://ruskinfelix.com, and if you scroll down it says

ABOUT RUSKIN FELIX

With 8+ years of overall experience, he has experience into Business Consulting, Strategy, Financial Audits (Internal and External), Taxation, Market research. He also has a good network of VCs and Angel Investors through his work in Investment banking and Private Equity Space. He is a Chartered Management Accountant, Qualified Member with CIMA (UK), and AICPA (US). He is also a Certified Financial Planner (CFP), Certified Stock market Professional (NCMP L-5). Currently working as the Founder of Ngen-ko Investments, he has also been working in other businesses in Media, Fashion and Web Development Industries.

And then below that it says “book with fiverr” and it brings you to his fiverr profile, so seems legit. And if it seems weird that a hedge fund would use Fiverr, he did say he has Fiverr stock, so he’s probably trying to give it exposure. From the beginning, after he saw the equity and liabilities, he wouldn't budge on his bear stance. He kept saying they will fail and run out of money in Q1 2021, even with recent momentum. The funny thing is though, that after enough arguing, even he eventually agreed that if they can make it past Q1 2021, and pass their April tests, then it has lots of potential and could be a greatly profitable company with good fundamentals. He says so in his report, I’ll link it below. (So I guess get in before the hedge funds find out about this shit) The other analyst, Tuna, was hired for $80 and he was interested in the tech and the possibilities of the devices made by MicroVision from the start, especially after I mentioned their use in the Hololens 2 and IVAS systems ordered by the military. Then once he saw the superiority of their technology over every other competitor, he was like ok this is a great opportunity. This scenario with two analysts with opposing viewpoints was actually ideal, because you want to hear both sides of the story, one bear take and one bull take, and there I was in a zoom call with two professionals arguing with each other over who was right. As they were writing the reports for the \~4 hours that I hired them for, I told them to research all the aspects of the company using this post, since it linked to a ton of DD on MVIS. [https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/lbeila/the\_best\_of\_rmvis\_meta\_thread\_v2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/lbeila/the_best_of_rmvis_meta_thread_v2/) Ruskin kinda skimmed it a little bit but then basically spent 90% of the four hours going through MVIS’s financial reports found here: [https://microvision.gcs-web.com/financial-information/quarterly-results](https://microvision.gcs-web.com/financial-information/quarterly-results) Of course, when you are 100% focused on the past of a company that has 90% of its value in the future, you will not see what others see, and you won’t have a positive view of the company. Like, he was literally going through every report all the way back to 2017, that’s how he found the IVAS money trail, even r/MVIS hasn’t found that yet. He had some bad takes, and missed some news that hasn’t showed up in financial reports yet that could have drastically changed his view. For example, he says 

With a very high burn rate and unsustainable operations, the company is looking at going out of cash reserves by Q1 2021 (as mentioned in their Quarterly Report (as on 30 Sept 2020)

But he missed the news that on December they secured extra funding. EVEN WITH him having missed the equity facility they got, he gave them a 50% chance of having the price of $25 by March, that really says something.

Tuna however, he listened and went through all the links I gave him, and he found projects that MVIS has worked on in the past for the military (additional hints that IVAS was made by MVIS), found good news videos, found a good ABC video on IVAS, the volkswagen thing, and he was the one with the idea about the airbags. He also found some nice images to include and much more. He actually understood the position this company would be in a year’s time, and didn’t seemed overly worried about an already fixed balance sheet. I can understand where Ruskin is coming from to an extend, he tried explaining why he was such a pessimist: he was managing other people’s money, so you have to only pick the stocks with the best fundamentals to avoid risk. Ironically though, he said he would short it, which is literally infinite risk lmao. I don’t know if he will still short it after seeing the loan MVIS was given, maybe he’ll even buy some.

* They've had heavy shareholder dilution (hard to argue with this one but they have enough cash to last them through 2021 and are hoping their financials improve with Hololens 2/IVAS sales this year so hopefully no more dilution).
* They don't have any production agreements with any of the big auto companies like VLDR and LAZR (Microvision has plenty of partnerships but they generally keep this stuff pretty secretive so we never know what's going on; they've had a partnership in the past with Volkswagen, though). However, the agreements that LAZR have are non-binding and a recent auto company exec was quoted as saying something along the lines of, ""Nobody gives a fuck where we get our LiDAR sensors from, as long as they meet the specs and are the cheapest"", so Microvision is poised to steal a lot of business out from under LAZR.
* They currently have shitty financials (not a ton of revenue and some debt; however, the debt is mostly pre-payments from Microsoft for the Hololens 2 production that doesn't need to be repaid and comes out of the royalties and also a PPP loan that doesn't need to be fully repaid).

289,LAZR," Just wanted to add a point that would make me feel bearish if I didn't already know the company. 

This shit has risen so far, so fast. I think someone not already in might look and scoff and say ""no way.. I'm not chasing something that's already risen that fucking high. That's how you get left holding the bag for the other assholes that got in while it was low"". People on the other side of the trade realize this and start to throw in buzz words like meme stock and pump and dump.

A simple counter argument as to why there's still gains to be had:

1. So many chances already for people to have taken their money and run from well under $1. Literal millionaires (some multi) have been made and many of them aren't done with it. If they feel there is still meat on the bones after years of putting up with this stock's shit, there probably is.

2. Just look at what the market recently has valued the competition (with not as good of a product) and realize we are still closer to the 1 Bil market cap cutoff needed to be able to even talk about it on here, than the 10-11 Billion market cap that LAZR currently enjoys. Still LOTS of room to run. That's not even taking into account the mind blowing possibility of a bidding war leading to a buyout. Who the fuck would dump that?

290,CEO," Extra on Luminar taken from earlier [linked post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/k7bzrk/race_to_mass_production_luminar_lazr_vs/), at bottom:

(2) In the Q and A, Luminar CEO Austin Russell is asked to contrast Luminar's lidar with ""MEMS based technologies or solid state"". Microvision was not named but is the demonstrable leader in MEMS based lidar by a large margin. **Russell did not answer the question**. He did not address MEMS at all. Instead, he pivoted to a commentary about ""pure solid state"" (i.e. no moving parts whatsoever, unlike MEMS) vs. Luminar's custom built mechanical approach, declaring Luminar's solution as the only viable one while criticizing the pure solid state approach as unworkable. He specifically alluded to companies that raised a lot of money for pure solid state with initial fanfare which have since fallen by the wayside (read[ Quanergy](https://quanergy.com/products/)). The answer given by Russell was astounding and revealing. If anyone in the industry knows that MEMS cannot be lumped in with other ""pure"" solid state technologies, it is Austin Russell. Yet that is exactly what he did specifically to avoid a difficult question in what was, in effect, a 2 hour infomercial for Luminar. Asked about MEMS, he erected a non-MEMS straw man and knocked it down. See video time **1:41:40** and following.

(3) Luminar states that the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for automotive lidar is **$150B**, expanding out to **$500B**.

**UPDATE, December 8, 2020 at 12:50 pm**

Eagle eyed internet sleuth[ u/s2upid](https://www.reddit.com/u/s2upid/) has unearthed a[ very recent patent application by Luminar](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200256960A1/en?oq=US20200256960A1)

suggesting that, despite what Russell has said or implied above, **Luminar does recognize the importance of MEMS mirror scanning for lidar**.

\[0037\] In particular embodiments, lidar system 100 may include a scanner 120 configured to scan an output beam 125 across a field of regard of the lidar system 100. As an example, **scanner 120 may include one or more scanning mirrors configured to pivot, rotate, oscillate, or move in an angular manner about one or more rotation axes**. The output beam 125 may be reflected by a scanning mirror, and as the scanning mirror pivots or rotates, the reflected output beam 125 may be scanned in a corresponding angular manner. As an example, a scanning mirror may be configured to periodically pivot back and forth over a 30-degree range, which results in the output beam 125 scanning back and forth across a 60-degree range (e.g., a Θ-degree rotation by a scanning mirror results in a 20-degree angular scan of output beam 125). \[0038\] In particular embodiments, **scanner 120 may include one or more mirrors, where each mirror is mechanically driven by a galvanometer scanner, a resonant scanner, a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) device**, a voice coil motor, an electric motor, or any suitable combination thereof. A galvanometer scanner (which may be referred to as a galvanometer actuator) may include a galvanometer-based scanning motor with a magnet and coil. When an electrical current is supplied to the coil, force is applied to the magnet, which causes a mirror attached to the galvanometer scanner to pivot. The electrical current supplied to the coil may be controlled to dynamically change the position of the galvanometer mirror. A resonant scanner (which may be referred to as a resonant actuator) may include a spring-like mechanism driven by an actuator to produce a periodic oscillation at a substantially fixed frequency (e.g., 1 kHz). **A MEMS-based scanning device may include a mirror with a diameter, length, or width between approximately 0.1 mm and 10 mm, and the mirror may be pivoted back and forth using electromagnetic or electrostatic actuation**. A voice coil motor (which may be referred to as a voice coil actuator) may include a magnet and coil. When an electrical current is supplied to the coil, a translational force is applied to the magnet, which causes a mirror attached to the magnet to move or rotate. An electric motor, such as for example, a brushless DC motor or a synchronous electric motor, may be used to continuously rotate a mirror at a substantially fixed frequency (e.g., a rotational frequency of approximately 1 Hz, 10 Hz, 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 500 Hz, or 1,000 Hz). For example, the mirror may be a polygon mirror that is continuously rotated by the synchronous electric motor in one rotation direction (e.g., clockwise or counter-clockwise relative to a particular rotation axis).

(2) In the Q and A, Luminar CEO Austin Russell is asked to contrast Luminar's lidar with ""MEMS based technologies or solid state"". Microvision was not named but is the demonstrable leader in MEMS based lidar by a large margin. **Russell did not answer the question**. He did not address MEMS at all. Instead, he pivoted to a commentary about ""pure solid state"" (i.e. no moving parts whatsoever, unlike MEMS) vs. Luminar's custom built mechanical approach, declaring Luminar's solution as the only viable one while criticizing the pure solid state approach as unworkable. He specifically alluded to companies that raised a lot of money for pure solid state with initial fanfare which have since fallen by the wayside (read[ Quanergy](https://quanergy.com/products/)).

328,IP," MVIS owns all the IP on the units and sold the production equipment to Microsoft so, yes, technically Microsoft makes it themselves now. I don't get your point.

Yeah, Microsoft paid $10M up-front. How does MVIS pay them back? With the royalties on every unit sold. Once the prepayment is exhausted, those royalties go straight to Microvision's bottom-line.

And I don't know where you got 50k units from. Microsoft has never stated any sales numbers publicly so the amount is pure speculation at this point.

334,MVIS," When selling a cash secure put, you give the right to someone sell you their shares for a certain price. Let's say you sell a put for mvis at 18, if at the expiration MVIS is below 18, you get to buy the shares at the 18 strike. The thing is, because you were paid a premium while selling the put, your cost basis for the shares is lower than 18. As someone said above, if you're paid a premium of 5 like you would be right now for a 18 strike put, your cost basis for buying the shares would effectively be 13 dollars per share which in my opinion is a pretty sweet deal since I don't see this going below 13",Lobstermonkeyyy,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljgtxj/mvis_shiny_laser_go_pew_no_but_seriously_they_are/gndvdr9/,0.039,0.758,0.203,0.9633

The 50,000 has more or less been a rumor I suppose but the consensus in the industry is that the sales for Hololens has been in the thousands and considering the price point, isn’t good. If it is even that high, then it is most likely a tremendous money loser given its price point. The total population revenue would be $175 mil.

337,MVIS," This right here is the main reason why I believe this company is a pump and dump scheme. All the false or incorrect incorrect information put out about this company. The community pumping this stock will not realize just how much BS info surrounds this company. 

Microsoft, not microvision got that contract, and it was for $480 mil not $700 mil. Of which MVIS out right sold the license for their tech to Microsoft for about $10 mil, up front with no royalties attached. So why bother bringing up Hololens as some winning tech for microvision, they took a quick payout.

344,MVIS," The current estimate is that it will be approximately $6.5 per share per billion BO price. So a 5 billion dollar buyout would be 6.5 x 5 = 32.5. (although I personally see that as a super conservative estimate). The top post on the MVIS subreddit has a ton of useful links that talk about this in depth. I've seen estimates for a buyout range anywhere from 2b to 30b.

When considering the price it's helpful to look at similar companies. There are companies who ONLY create Lidar (and it's inferior to MVIS prototypes) who have >10b market cap right now. I don't want to be too hopeful because the sector is still pretty speculative but there's a 'best case scenario' that looks really good for the buyout.",stopearthmachine,18,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljgtxj/mvis_shiny_laser_go_pew_no_but_seriously_they_are/gndmwz7/,0.022,0.78,0.198,0.9658

349,GME," SLV will break and it is already happening. PSLV is the way. 

If you look at the silver dealers its almost impossible to get actual physical silver for less than $5 more than the paper cost. That's what the silver squeeze was about. Pushing all of this paper silver out, and squeezing the shorts. Silver is one of the most shorted markets in the world and when this one busts open all of Wall Street is going to be covered in jizz. 

And I know no one wants to hear this but the thing I like about physical silver and the silversqueeze is that they can't just turn it off like they did with GME. If you hold 100 ounces in your basement that's all there is to it. To pull a GME on physical silver is literally robbery.

356,AP," No, they're not ""broke"".  Learn what an AP is before you post crap like this.

You can find the list of bars that SLV already owns here year the top right: https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239855/ishares-silver-trust-fund

What the rule says for those who can't read big boy words is that APs are not allowed to deliver futures to create baskets, becuase futures can be cash settled, and SLV wouldn't get the physical.

SLV is *actually* saying that they don't trust futures contracts to deliver and will only buy *actual real silver bars that they can take immediate delivery on*.

Some people speculate that this might drive the price of SLV above spot, because traders can go buy paper from the COMEX for 30/oz and then the comex can just say, oh no, you don't get your bar, here's some cash for the price we say the future is settled at.  SLV won't put up with this shit, they demand the actual physical, and so when someone tries to give them this paper bullshit, they say no thanks, no new shares for you, go sell your future to some chump.

364,GME," CNBC got this so wrong... that WSB was trying to force a short squeeze.  It’s never going to squeeze hard like GME and that whole thing was a distraction. SLV (and better yet, physical silver) is an inflation hedge and given the amount of liquidity that is being pumped into the economy I think we have a real risk of some significant inflation in Q3/Q4.

The only way to get actual physical in size, guaranteed, will be to buy shares of SLV in a multiple of the basket size, hand those shares to your broker to turn over to an AP, who will then ""delete"" the shares and select some bars from SLVs inventory to transfer to your allocated account.

My point is, with demand so high across the technical spectrum and existing players ramping up manufacturing efforts, parsing the anticipated expanded capability of each manufacturer by level of technical complexity (like, how fucking sophisticated the fucking chip is) would be useful--this is supply. Then you parse the demand in a similar way. That would break out into seperate markets for seperate levels of chip based on complexity, and would explain how, in a major shortage, different companies could target different segments of the market and all make a killing.

417,AMD," Weak DD. They mine E T H not B T C. Mining efficiency is vastly different between AMD and NVIDIA cards.

AMD and NVIDIA will profit less from the chip shortage. They are missing out on sales (esp. nasty for AMD that has to balance consoles (little money), cpus (good money), gpus (less good money). Perhaps some of the price diff can be captured by them. But more likely it’s card manufacturers, scalpers and OEMs.
The chip shortage will not resolve before 2023 unless if some move to other/newer nodes to open capacity on 7nm. But then the same problem exists on 5nm.
Really Intel is profiting from the shortage the most, I think.

459,AAPL," I think that may be the better play. I’m bullish on AMD as a company in general (my last few desktop CPUs have been AMD and I’m currently rocking a 5600x), but not as a stock in the medium term. Few reasons for this.

Firstly, the competitive landscape. In CPU land AMD have the upper hand at the moment. This *may* be fleeting, with leaks relating to the next gen Intel chips looking promising (obviously we need to wait and see). It’s possible that they can’t take advantage of their market leading position because of constrained supply. AMD aren’t historically the CPU leaders across the board as they are now, so you have to wonder whether Intel will take the lead again just as supply constraints loosen, taking much larger volume than is currently possible. They may have missed their window. Other competitors come from ARM based CPUs, where you’d have to consider AAPL a threat given the astonishing per w performance of the M1, and Qualcomm amongst others. And then there are the GPUs, where AMD are at least a generation behind on two key technologies compared to Nvidia (ray tracing and DLSS) that are becoming increasingly important. DLSS in particular, and AMD’s dismissal of it as an approach up until recently is worrying as it’s the difference between a game being playable or not. Mining is a consideration, not for Bee Tea Sea as others have pointed out (not used GPUs for well over 5 years now), but for others. This is going to push up demand, but I think there’s another issue.

The other is their corporate strategy of being a chip designer and renting out the foundry. Intel have their own. This means that when there is constrained supply they are going to end up in bidding wars against other customers for foundry resources. At the very least this will drive up costs (Ryzen 5000 series chips are more expensive than their predecessors) and at the worst they simply won’t be able to get sufficient resources and their supply will remain constrained. Remember that their competing against companies like AAPL for foundry resources (AAPL have their own foundry, but are still heavily reliant on external suppliers for volume). I wouldn’t want to be bidding against the biggest company on earth. Generally, I think outsourcing the actual manufacturing of chips to external suppliers has been a good thing, but in supply constrained economies like the one we’re currently in it doesn’t look quite the home run it has been to now. Remember that when the next gen Intel chips launch, Intel can fire up their own foundries to fab them where AMD cannot. If you need a new chip, you’ll probably go with Intel just because of availability even if it’s 2% worse than the AMD competitor. These are manufacturing issues, the distribution issues remain worldwide so if the distribution is more problematic than the manufacturing, then this may not be an issue.

There’s just one other, possibly incredibly minor, issue too. AMD Ryzen CPUs have been using the same socket design for years now. This means that there’s a relatively simple upgrade path for users who can literally just swap out a CPU and get significant performance improvements. Zen 4 is moving to a new socket design, which means people will need a new motherboard should they want to upgrade. This may suppress demand a bit. I don’t think it will have a massive impact, but it does mean that if there are any supply constraints on motherboards (there are currently) this may further suppress demand. Hard to predict this one though, and Intel have been changing socket types seemingly every 6 months without too much issue (although again, they’re a larger player to motherboard manufacturers might be more willing to throw resources at meeting the market).

I’d love to be wrong. Really. I also have either too many or to few chromosomes, so don’t listen to me.",essjay2009,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljp713/why_i_think_amd_is_going_up_a_lot_soon/gngk6qq/,0.071,0.857,0.072,-0.2118

475,AAPL," Apple's M1 is only a threat if you expect Apple to start selling CPUs to OEMs, which I don't think anyone does.

Apple's change to M1 was to bump their margins. It's not looking like they're likely to steal market share for switching to it so there's no threat to AMD which can do very well just chipping away at Intel's market share.

Apple's M1 is also on a more advanced node than Ryzen 5000 so there's no competition for wafers from Apple. AMD's not switching to that node for another year and who knows what TSMC or Apple will have then in terms of capacity and node use. (You'd expect more TSMC capacity, right? Consoles will have lower demand then. And that's if Apple hasn't moved on to 3nm, which is possible)

>Other competitors come from ARM based CPUs, where you’d have to consider AAPL a threat given the astonishing per w performance of the M1, and Qualcomm amongst others. 

People have been talking about RISC killing x86 for years, yet here we are, and Qualcomm doesn't have a product announced, nevermind one anyone can buy. They completely gave up on their server CPU plans, and that's where the real fat margins are. 


>(Ryzen 5000 series chips are more expensive than their predecessors) 

Ryzen 5000 is on the same node as their predecessor, that was a margin move by AMD, and one that hasn't dented sales at all.

>Zen 4 is moving to a new socket design, which means people will need a new motherboard should they want to upgrade. This may suppress demand a bit.

It won't. It's been the norm for Intel for many generations to need new boards as you said, and Intel boards have generally been more expensive, so it's practically going to be a non-factor for AMD in the same way as it was for Intel. Some uninformed enthusiasts will probably bitch about it, but they've no right to, this has been on the cards for years. In the end they'll upgrade because it's one time vs every time with Intel, and it's not like Intel offers them a better system.

Lastly, you're much more optimistic about Intel's products than I am as someone who's following AMD closely. I think it's going to be 3-5+ years before Intel has a long term competitive product at this point. The weight of their manufacturing capabilities aren't worth much if their products end up being the low margin only offering that AMD used to hold, and that seems to be the current trend based on their financials from last year where they had to slash their margins.",EverythingIsNorminal,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljp713/why_i_think_amd_is_going_up_a_lot_soon/gngtl05/,0.078,0.882,0.04,-0.9191

485,AMD," > Intels problem are multifold and wil require seismic shifts and cash

Intels problem is and was that they couldn't transition to the latest process nodes. They still have an extremely capable army of engineers. When transistors shrink you can fit more transistors per chip, power consumption and cost go down and speed increases. That's why AMD has been able to outcompete Intel. If Intel manages to go to 5 nm (or 3 nm with [ASML's EUV lithography process](https://www.asml.com/en/products/euv-lithography-systems)) suddenly Intel will be back as #1 in the CPU business, manufacturing **in their own fabs** as opposed to using TSMC (Taiwan) like AMD.

508,MU," because DRAM spot prices are still going up constantly, contract prices have lagged spot prices considerably in the prior couple months, meaning they will increase significantly shortly (assuming they havent already).

MU's profit is still nowhere near where it was during the last upcycle, when demand for DRAM has grown significantly more than supply compared to the 2018 peak.

The last 2 trough to peak for MU has been ~5->35 then ~10->60. This cycles trough was $28, so thinking 87 is the peak when valuations have become WAY more stretched than the past seems like incorrect thinking.

Furthermore, look at the previous 2 peaks, they are rounded tops where the price stays near the peak for 3-6 months, which is when institutions know the peak is here and keep the price high while they unload. MU has shown no sign of a rounded top and is still in full upswing.

However, my only qualms with this DD is on the currency part. The FED/Treasury are purchasing bonds off banks in order to drive interest rates down, but this also causes a shortage of USD. They're going to keep doing these purchases until the 30-y interest rates reverse direction and heads towards 0% to spur lending (they have papers that allude to this as well). They're going to start shrinking the supply of bonds in the up coming March or April auctions  to create a supply shortage (GME baby!). When the 30-y finally reverses direction, the dollar will rally (or visa versa) and the dollar will go back to 2020 high or higher. EU have been struggling more with deflation/disinflation than we have, so the currency pairing is still likely to tank in the coming months just due to worsening economics.

Execution is awful man. They’re slow, they can’t figure their shit out, their new products are weak, Google is owning them and they do nothing proprietary their competition is actually making big ground against them.

Trivago strategy was to dump a TON of investor money into ad spend hoping that their very basic, no moat platform would get traffic, and they can charge high click premiums for their auctions. 

Execution was absolutely awful, they threw nearly all in TV ads in ever market imaginable, no focus. 

That worked while the money was flowing and when the ad dollars were pumping - they had traffic that collapsed when the ad spend finally slowed down, after Booking and Expedia figured out their bidding model was not even customer friendly and even raised prices to game trivago. 

And where did Trivago go get traffic? By buying up ads on Googles own hotel price comparison.  

So basically the reality hotel? Google. And trivago then pays to advertise its lowest price in hopes of selling another click. 


And the next trend in their space is find hotel who is a Dutch startup doing what Trivago should have done from day one —- they will be taking more of trivagos shrinking pie.

If you can load the fuck up on these with 1% or of your portfolio or less, **GAMMA SQUEEZE** the 🐻s to death!! It will only take a *small catalyst event* to trigger.

I'm doing this week after week because it is totally worth the risk, even if this week expires worthless or the next or the next. If I only get modest gains from a small move, I'll just roll them into next week and repeat. 

NOK ain't dead yet boys, I tried to give my take on AMC options play here (*automod said market cap was too small, so fuck tendies for you guys*) here before it went up to $20 overnight. It was literally the only thing that saved my portfolio after 💎✋s GME with you idiots.

If everyone smashes some weekly FDs on NOK, I see a potential for a huge move. Maybe not AMC or GME level, but still some major tendies for a very low risk.

It’s a complicated process but essentially the buying of your stock isn’t instant and they have to reach out to a broker to get the stock. To guarantee the price until the purchase they have to insure the stock in case the buyer backs out. The crazy amount of interest in these stocks had made the price of insuring these purchases crazy expensive and the short of it is that Robinhood doesn’t have the cash on hand to insure all these purchases. It’s not the hedge funds strong arming Robinhood to do this. It’s just a flaw in the system Robinhood uses so that you don’t have to pay $75 in fees every time you want to buy a stock.",GoldfinchTheo,-3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljdmhg/description_of_what_happened_with_rh/gncrtgq/,0.06,0.809,0.131,0.8967

With the rate that Corsair is going, they could easily be $80, especially since they've diversified better than Logitech, getting into RAM and SSD.

If the price even rose by $10 for some insane reason that would be $3,000 but that’s extremely unlikely and even in the event that did happen I’d still be up 3k on the year.

790,GM," Let’s talk about averages not me

I make $210k, in my 20s, single no kids. I max out my Roth TSP/401k/IRA every year. They’re in Vanguard 2055, VTSAX, and G fund (very risk adverse). 

My situation is not the median. We should talk median. Not every person can work in tech. Not everyone can be a plumber - who picks our crops? Who makes our cars? Why can’t a 20 year old American have the same lifestyle as a boomer who made cars for GM or Ford in their early working years? It’s because boomers vote in selfish policy (fiscal and other) and have pulled the ladder up, giving the middle finger to everyone after

So stop projecting. If you’re older, I bet you’re “poor” and should have just worked in tech. Eric Schmidt or Chamath or Elon did it, why you so poor?

794,NEW," i'm holding about 500 shares around 6$ but i saw the ability of this as soon as began looking into too, its just such an obvious upgrade: if all data holds up, then the other vaccines on the market. in all aspects, its a better upgrade in manufacturing, distribution, raw material supply line, the only thing it doesn't have going for them right now is name and power, but their science board is full of Pfizer people. i also think its not even going to be that hard to get EAU seeing as they will take anything with over 50% efficacy rating stated by the fda last summer. its a vaccine being given to millions of human beings and is already going to trials children, the fda sees all that too even if there is concrete complete phase 3 data, the fda knows millions are taking it and are fine. the only reason it will get denied by the fda is if OCUGEN hasn't set up safe manufacturing sites, they are asking for EAU which consists of proving safe efficacy and vaccine manufacturing and distribution, see as Ocugen has been moving this way for months they must have know since fall 20. so id hope they already had huge manufacturing acquisitions already of buildings and land and delivery trucks, they will have to upscale quickly in hiring as well but because it is such a widely used way to create vaccines the inactive virus there is going to be more available techs and industry equipment that's already around, unlike the mRNA production that requires specific NEW scaled up equipment and experts which are few and far between, i believe the raw material shortage is only gonna get worse for the mRNA ones. If this is the first vaccine in america kids can use before the fall semester it will be a 200$ stock, that's when i plan to sell right when supply of Covaxin meets the demand of kids needing it to reopen the school system fully and the first step back to normality",oifvet0809,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljnr0v/do_you_need_some_variety_in_your_life_tired_of/gnfo93x/,0.055,0.881,0.064,0.4677

814,EV," $TSLA is $GME on steroids. Back 5 years ago, Tesla was revolutionary and very unprofitable. Today Tesla is barely profitable (trading in regulatory credits that is) and no longer revolutionary. 

This year already you will see EVs better than Tesla’s being released and sold. By the end of 2022, Tesla’s market share among all EVs will drop below 50% in the US; (it’s already behind VW group’s EV marketshare in Europe). By 2030, Tesla’s worldwide marketshare will be below 10% of all EVs. 

Why is Tesla worth $800 billion today or will be worth $1 trillion in March? The only reason is a cult following. Tesla’s valuation should be about $40 billion to $60 billion, but given their CEO’s charisma, perhaps $80 billion would be reasonable. The downside of $TSLA is at least 90%.

There’s no way in hell for any non-hype company to be at the trillion dollar valuation while turning in $721 million in annual net profit. This net profit was only possible thanks to selling regulatory carbon credits because without the $1.58 billion in proceeds from the sale of regulatory carbon credits in 2020, Tesla would show a net loss for 2020. So, a car company that can’t figure out how to make a profit making cars for 10 years now and facing fierce competition starting now and getting only fiercer with each upcoming year is valued at over $800 billion. If you think it’s undervalued, I can’t help you.

I would bet that over 90% of Tesla shareholders don’t even know that Tesla is still unprofitable on their core business or that it compensâtes its staggering losses by selling carbon credits.",rozhasi,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljde6l/why_tsla_is_actually_still_undervalued_at_these/gnejm4p/,0.069,0.794,0.137,0.9596

841,ALL," Just so you know, the Canada ban has enormous repricussions on the whole large ship cruise economy.

Foreign keeled and flagged vessels are required to stop in Canada on voyages that cruise to Alaska, or at the very least make port in a foreign country for ALL cruises on US loops.

Politicians are trying to waive this however there is little incentive for an industry that operates intentionally as far out of US jurisdictions as they possibly can. They won't even get a bailout if they need it for this reason.

Finally, pretty much every cruise company has piled on massive amounts of debt and is at great risk of massive dilution at some point during their recovery.

I'd wait till Oct/Nov before I even touch a cruise stock, and then plan on shitloads of dilution the second it looks half decent again",Sars250,20,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljigkl/now_is_the_best_time_to_buy_cruise_ship_calls/gnddnoc/,0.068,0.861,0.071,0.1035

you have to actually fucking pick and choose your investments (if you dont have a robo-viser do it for you) and trade smart to make sure you get gains, and you have to reinvest dividends everytime you get them.

Problem for me with webull is A: there are no robo-visers

B: DRIP isnt an option to my knowledge on the roth IRA

C: no fractional shares in the IRA

D: can't place orders unless its within trading hours. (IE I cant place an order at midnight to be placed and executed at day open that day)

RH would be pretty great if they had an IRA option tbh, I feel like the ease of access and ease of use for robinhood is way better suited for people to grow money slowly over time.

And unfortunately garbage people a lot of the time.

Stuff that Wizards can never print again. 1k per card minimum. But wizard isn't making money from these big shifts in the secondary market. They only make money at the press. And just like

MTG is in a crazy state and is a small microcosm of asset inflation.

1017,TLRY," Weed is an extremely volatile sector. When one major stock in the sector goes up for any reason, the entire sector mirrors it for no reason.

In this case, TLRY was primed for a short squeeze and waiting a catalyst to set it off. News broke of a senator announcing he was going to begin an effort for federal legalization (can still take years). This news was positive however, and enough to spark the TLRY squeeze.

The entire industry followed TLRY with no fundamental reason for any of the other companies (except APHA). Once the squeeze was over, TLRY tanked and brought the rest of the sector with it.

This was a singular short squeeze that dragged the entire sector along for the ride.

There is still upside to weed, and it will always be a high risk, unpredictable sector. There will be countless run ups and dumps in the journey to legalization. Another pump and dump after legalization, and then once legalization is in place many of them will be acquired or go out of business as large corporations take over the market.",AJDillonsMiddleLeg,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljfoxf/simple_question_are_weed_stocks_going_up_and_why/gndiaju/,0.083,0.889,0.029,-0.8074
1018,TLRY," IMHO, investments should depend on what you think of the company and the general trend. If you think TLRY can compete with other cannabis stocks, then such a person would hold until it bumps up. I don’t know the cannabis market for Canada and can’t give input on that. But as soon as a cannabis stock supplier provides to US citizens, that stock will have potential. US can mitigate debt (through tax) with cannabis just like Canada did, and Canada weed will certainly strive to consume a federally illegal US weed stock market.",TwinEclipse,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljfoxf/simple_question_are_weed_stocks_going_up_and_why/gncg4ed/,0.064,0.885,0.051,-0.296

1112,TSLA," So there are some reasons that you didnt mention as to why the current time is different. 

First, unlike in the dot com boom where conpanies with no revenue and no assets were reaching sky-high valuations, now the companies with the largest valuations are huge, multinational companies with insane profits.There is likely no economic downturn that would cause Amazon or Microsoft to go bankrupt for instance.


Second, wealth concentration is at one of the highest levels ever. Now, this is in a lot of cases a bad thing, but it also divorces stocks from economic reality (as we have seen during the corona virus). Back in 2000, there were a lot more ""individual"" investors as a percentage of stock market wealth. So when the economy tumbles, you had a lot of people who HAVE to sell or take money out of retirement accounts in order to get by. If you have more millionaires and billionaires, then even if there is a downturn, they likely only need to readjust, not actually withdraw capital. Most of the money stays in the market (where else can it go?)

Yep, I see the chaos it would create with no protections for tenants.  I also see the chaos it will create with no rights for landlords.  The best case a landlord can hope for, is that their bank gives them forbearance (and allows the missing mortgage payments to be tacked onto the end of their term).  The renters can't be expected to make up the rent payments they missed, so ultimately this hardship falls on the landlord alone.

Killing AT&T is like killing Boeing and that's just not going to happen regardless of how people feel that's wrong or right.

Their saving grace might be HBO MAX depending on how much good quality content they can keep pumping out and get people to sign up for it despite Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Apple TV, YoutubeTV all playing in the same market and now with Paramount+ coming into the mix people are going to start getting tired of this streaming bullshit real soon.",royalsanguine,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljlatb/unga_bunga_unga_bunga_att_dd/gndscbh/,0.171,0.723,0.106,-0.9543

Stimulus checks come in. Ape instant deposits all hit. Another meme wave bankrupts a million, then another. Within a week they're wiped out.

Cathie is dead, no one knows how. The apes take refuge in Grapevine, Texas, at the GME headquarters. There are no more markets; they trade bottlecaps and CDs. Billions are dead, but there's hope to rebuild. A World Government is formed, Papa Elon reigns supreme. The markets return, and GME is one of the first to be relisted.

1334,GME," I'm not hating on anyone lol. I called out someone who wasn't an active redditor and suddenly they have 3 weeks straight of bashing GME. That's extraordinarily suspicious behavior. 

The point is that it takes effort to read comments and respond to things. If you have no interest in something and other people's outlooks aggravate you, why are you even reading these things, let alone taking the time to articulate a response? You either have a sad excuse of a life and wallow in misery and looking for company or you have an interest in what's going on. Healthy, well balanced people do not subscribe to this behavior.

If you had to ask if price would go below $200, you don't have a clue as to what was happening and didn't take the time to do any research of your own.  Stocks tend to sit around their fair valuation with fluctuations depending on news/rumors, quarterlies, etc. This was a short squeeze, but it had its legs cut off in the middle of it by various brokerages pulling shenanigans. This led to a loss of momentum, a shift in sentiment, and then some big investors jumped ship with their profits. 

Your 4 shares definitely isn't sticking it to anyone by holding. If you're a part of a group that consists of millions of people holding 4 shares, it's very substantial. Whether this thing gains momentum and moons again, only time will tell. 

As for your money being better used elsewhere today, that all depends on how/where you spend it. If you join another stock on the way down, like you did with GME by the sound of it, you've just lost more money. There's no guarantees with the stock market. Just know that selling your GME shares increases the volume available to short so the HFs can just keep kicking the can down the road, or they can use those shares to cover positions. Again, your 4 shares don't mean much.

The war isn't over, but if the battle was going like everyone here hopes it was going we would be at least above 100$. The price is set right where the hedgies aren't bleeding enough to die, if they aren't dying they're recovering. They obviously shorted the stock even more at the 300$ range so that puts pressure on the wound too. I don't believe the hedgies portfolio is as red as mine, I'm losing this fight. So I'll draw back to fight another day in this war.

I know war more than stocks. When your opponent is fighting, remain calm. When they are overconfident, attack. That's why I'll wait till 35$. I bet they're shorting more as soon as it falls pass 45$

I actually believed the game would be faire on the 27th. Now I don't. We learn someway right lol only doing smart investing from now on. No hype trains or FOMO. If FOMO is involved I missed it because the ones that weren't are in green. 

Now then, if the stock is still in the 30$ by the 15th of March, I see this as the hedgies failing to bring down GME. If they still haven't covered they may start struggling to hold the pressure when the lawsuits starts taking it's toll. In this brief period of weakness, another short squeeze would defeat them.

1353,ALL," TL:DR warning

Robinhood got called at 4am Thurs late Jan (29) to cough up $3 Billion to the DTCC as collateral because the volume of meme stock trades was going stratospheric and settlement work volume was going through the roof and costing DTC a fortune to process (that's the claim of the truth).  The DTCC supposedly also upped the requirements at other brokerages like Interactive, TD, Schwab and Etrade.  Only Fidelity had liquidity to front the money without restricting their customers' trades AFAIK.  

My question was, DTCC is a private near-monopoly corporation on trade settlement, and their biggest customers are the high-frequency trading hedge funds.  Why did they allow the hedge funds to trade (buy-sell) when they asked the retail brokerages for more money and force them to halt buy-side trades?  Did Melvin get margin called and that's why Citadel fronted them $3 Billion as collateral so they can hold onto their shorts and hold out against the squeeze by not buying to cover?  Did they hide their short interests by buying long OTM calls to fake out the public data to trick retail into selling because they pay their financial media buddy shills to say ""it's over, move on?""  

We will never know if the DTCC and Citadel, Point72 and others were all in bed talking on burner phones like in the show ""Billions"" to plot a joint defense of their money game.  But they know the game and know if they clamp down on the brokerages, the regulations will force the brokerages through clearinghouse settlement requirements to clamp down on the retail traders.  The HFs were going to bleed not tens of billions but hundreds of billions covering their synthetic shorts that the DTC was complicit in fostering.  They were smart enough to see if they can force selling, they can borrow/buy into the pumped prices as new shorts and make offset gains to erase their big losses.  They are after all, hedge funds. 

The SEC and everyone in the game, even FINRA know that if the DTC margin calls the hedge funds and they default and cannot meet the settlement requirements from GME and other memes rocketing up, it will be worse than 2008 as massive selloffs cascade throughout the entire stock market because retail investors won't get the money they won in the squeeze because the HFs won't pay, or have to sell ALL their longs to meet the margin call.  It would have been one of the greatest wealth transfer events of our time, but I believe it would short-circuit the game Wall Street has set up, so they called a time-out, and the SEC/FINRA (refs) will just plea ignorance to the whole affair just to let the game keep going as is.  If retail breaks the game, no one gets to play, and the refs have no jobs at the SEC, or Wall Street.  Self-interest won, again.  

They are gambling that they will get fined by the SEC, maybe $100,000,000?  But it is a drop in the bucket compared to $500 Billion - $2 Trillion in actual losses from forced liquidation of their long positions that causes a 1929's panic crash or worse as all investors sell to save their gains/holdings.

They know we make the rules and can change the rules any time we want right?  Bunch of retards.""

I am only speculating on what may have gone down.  Maybe some whistleblower at those firms will step forward one day to reveal what happened.  If it was all legit, and the game was not meant to favor retail traders making risky bets that only hedge funds can play and win at, then maybe retail investors have to decide whether to play this game by these rules.

Did they hide their short interests by buying long OTM calls to fake out the public data to trick retail into selling because they pay their financial media buddy shills to say ""it's over, move on?""  

We will never know if the DTCC and Citadel, Point72 and others were all in bed talking on burner phones like in the show ""Billions"" to plot a joint defense of their money game.  But they know the game and know if they clamp down on the brokerages, the regulations will force the brokerages through clearinghouse settlement requirements to clamp down on the retail traders.  The HFs were going to bleed not tens of billions but hundreds of billions covering their synthetic shorts that the DTC was complicit in fostering.  They were smart enough to see if they can force selling, they can borrow/buy into the pumped prices as new shorts and make offset gains to erase their big losses.  They are after all, hedge funds. 

The SEC and everyone in the game, even FINRA know that if the DTC margin calls the hedge funds and they default and cannot meet the settlement requirements from GME and other memes rocketing up, it will be worse than 2008 as massive selloffs cascade throughout the entire stock market because retail investors won't get the money they won in the squeeze because the HFs won't pay, or have to sell ALL their longs to meet the margin call.  It would have been one of the greatest wealth transfer events of our time, but I believe it would short-circuit the game Wall Street has set up, so they called a time-out, and the SEC/FINRA (refs) will just plea ignorance to the whole affair just to let the game keep going as is.  If retail breaks the game, no one gets to play, and the refs have no jobs at the SEC, or Wall Street.  Self-interest won, again.  

They are gambling that they will get fined by the SEC, maybe $100,000,000?  But it is a drop in the bucket compared to $500 Billion - $2 Trillion in actual losses from forced liquidation of their long positions that causes a 1929's panic crash or worse as all investors sell to save their gains/holdings.  They will pay it, laugh at Redditors, and go back to their 30 year whiskey rooms and smoke cigars, telling stories of ""Remember that time a bunch of retail day-traders tried to take us down using our own game?  They know we make the rules and can change the rules any time we want right?  Bunch of retards.""

I am only speculating on what may have gone down.  Maybe some whistleblower at those firms will step forward one day to reveal what happened.  If it was all legit, and the game was not meant to favor retail traders making risky bets that only hedge funds can play and win at, then maybe retail investors have to decide whether to play this game by these rules.  Use multiple brokerage accounts at least.  Don't bet except what you can afford to see go to 0.  Your life's value is not your bank account, not your financial gains or losses.  Do your homework, and opportunities will come, just save your ammo and be ready for the next move to appear in front of you.",unichronic,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljn946/robinhood_did_nothing_wrong/gng62yj/,0.073,0.828,0.099,0.9782
