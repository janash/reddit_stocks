1,BB," I recently have become the opposite!

I almost dread Mondays, I do not look forward to the uncertainty. I have made a good amount of money this year and do not want to lose it.

My investment approach is reasonably sensible in my opinion (e.g no exotic wild stocks such as GME/Cineworld/BB/Nokia).  I am NOT an emotional investor, I am willing to ride the waves and invest based on fundamentals.

I usually buy dips when I have spare cash. I bought shares when prices were low (leaving me a large buffer for when stocks dip in price).

I'm not an emotional investor, I will not act on my emotion when the market is seeing red but I definitely feel it when red days do come. (most of the time I will look for opportunities to buy during red days).

Then again, I love Mondays when the stock market sees green, that makes me happy.",georgejk7,2,/r/stocks/comments/m1xj80/anyone_else_kinda_look_forward_to_mondays_now/gqh09bu/,0.065,0.788,0.147,0.9584

49,AAPL," The user you’re replying to is saying Roblox is overvalued in comparison to its fundamentals. It continues not to turn a profit. The valuation refers to the company floated as worth 40B, rather than the share price.

Not sure what you mean by “seeing a low stock price” equating to a buy, but make sure you familiarise yourself with market fundamentals before jumping in. Based on what you’re saying, you seem to be equating share price sub $50 in a company as “good”, when the *value* of a share relates to the company’s market cap, fundamentals and growth trajectory. Paying $3000 for an AMZN share is likely to be a better investment than RBLX at $100, for example. 

Final point to bear in mind, is that stock price relates to market cap. A company like TSM or AAPL have shares that are “only” around the $115/120 mark, but they have 600B and 2T dollar market caps, respectively. 

(Stock splits occur over time. If AAPL had never split, it would be around $30,000 a share. The point here is that, with no underlying knowledge of fundamentals, you might see TSLA at $800 a share and think a company that’s performing well, fills a niche and dominates its market segment like TSM is “only” trading around $115 in comparison.

55,MTX," Saw a bunch of comments that MTX means microtransactions, but no one actually explained it and figured if you didn't know the acronym it might be a bit foreign.

&#x200B;

Household videogames used to be sold as standalone product that required a single upfront purchase and left you with the ability to play forever. In recent times, that was a $60 upfront cost and no future expenses associated with it.

&#x200B;

Some firms figured out people are happy to throw more money at games by adding expansions which can be downloaded and consolidated into a singular game experience with more modern technology. This emerged as $10-$20 expansions, sometimes as many as 4 or 5 for a single game so the upfront purchase plus the expansions made lifetime revenues of closer to $120 for your all in gamer.

&#x200B;

I'm not sure which caught on as the big ones, but some developers figured out that if you add tiny changes to the games, people will pay tiny amounts of money and not really notice. An example would be playing Pac-Man, but paying $1 to make your character Mrs. Pac-Man instead. There are now games fueled on this structure where the game itself is actually free, but there are hundreds or even thousands of small little things to buy to enhance the game in one way or another. While some players don't put in any money, some end up buying all or nearly all of the items for sale. Sometimes there are even recurring items to buy such as more attempts before failure, more time to play on a time restricted game, etc. These players that pay a lot are referred to as whales. Whales pay so much that these games are often highly profitable.",wingatewhite,41,/r/stocks/comments/m1owvy/roblox_reference_share_price_set_at_45_ahead_nyse/gqg2smz/,0.067,0.853,0.08,0.7936

192,OR," As I understand it the fee structure was set up in such a way that they are not making the kind of revenue they should be -- In order to change it they would need to increase prices on Robux or they need to reduce the payout to the developers OR they need a big increase in monthly memberships. 

The monthly memberships don't add much value from what I can tell so far -- my kid plays this game all the time. For her, it makes more sense to use some of her weekly allowance ($10 a week) which equals more than she would get if she was a member each month -- so they have that all out of whack. If it made sense (was a better value) I would have signed her up for it. So I don't see it taking off. 

The idea introduced that all this money spent is staying in-company does not make sense to me because the money goes to the specific game developers within Roblox minus whatever is taken by the platform. That is not staying in the company. 

I really WANT to invest in this company if for no other reason than to get some of my pile of money I have dumped into it on behalf of my kid back.

Roblox being a platform for users to develop their own content (and generate their own revenue) essentially makes Roblox the YouTube of the gaming world. Youtube is now a massive part of the video industry, and professionals generate content on youtube to make money. Why would Activision try to compete with the Roblox platform when they could instead just make games on the Roblox platform? Not saying they would, but building platforms is different from building video games, just like tv studios aren't really competing with youtube even though they exist within the same space.

342,ATVI," The claim that ATVI has better programmers than Roblox, I would argue, is patently false. I know that some of my most talented and motivated classmates in computer science are going to work at Roblox, and their hiring bar is extremely high. Roblox is seen by some as a better destination for a software engineer than even some big tech companies like Amazon.

According to levels.fyi data, a new grad software engineer at Roblox makes almost $100k more per year than their equivalent at Blizzard. Roblox new grads are also paid more than those at Google and Facebook. I would argue that these factors are strong indications that Roblox is hiring some of the most talented engineers on the market.

361,ANY," As someone who is writing this on Centurylink Fiber going to the home, I can tell you that the customer experience I had to deal with on getting this put in was a PITA.  I was transferred around to a few different departments who didn't really know what I wanted, and when they finally created the order, and I had to move the date out (new house wasn't finished building yet), they couldn't change the date on the order.  They literally had to cancel the original order, and create a new one.  Problem is, the old order is still tied to my account, so when I have a billing issue, I can't look up the correct system on my account, and when I call them, they have no idea how to fix it.

Level 3 used to be HQed right next to my house, so I have some familiarity with this company due to having a lot of friends who worked there.  Back in the day they were constantly buying out new companies to ""deworsification"" themselves.  The company was constantly struggling to make a profit, and the old Centurylink (which used to be the old QWest, which used to be the old US West) never really had any plans to grow.

With this all being said, is this a company you should run to the hills on? No, but I don't see any growth in the company in at least a year or two.  The dividend is pretty good if the stock is down to like $9, so that helps.  If you're looking for a value stock, this is a decent company, but I don't see ANY growth in it unless they merge with another growing company.",Armadillos_CO,2,/r/stocks/comments/m1jabe/analysis_lumn_lumen_technologies/gqeungm/,0.057,0.844,0.1,0.926

In a similar vein, sorta a value reopening play, I like GLP, global limited partners.They run a huge chain of gas stations in New England mostly as well as some gasoline blending and distro, but the real moneymakers are the little convenience stores, and their business was really hit hard by the lack of travel and some of those stores being shut down for a while as well with the decreased traffic and nonessential store closures, etc. They actually added a whole mess of gas stations to the network, and added EV charging and stuff as well, basically tried to expand and modernize a bit during the pandemic. It’s a pretty solid boomer stock that I think will get a nice boost from everyone moving around more, commutes restarting, etc....and it pays a 10 or 11% dividend as well.

414,AMC," But AMC's stock was already depressed due to last year. So even if they do 'bad' the stock will still tend upwards, because they are doing better than they were.

415,AMC," The way you’re thinking makes absolutely no sense. 

Doing better doesn’t equate to share prices going up. 

I don’t want to come off as offensive, but you’ve clearly never been in a management position or let alone operated a business. 

When cash flow is 7x outweighed by debt, not including the fore coming rental obligations, the company itself is already failing.

Your logic is as follows: pre-pandemic Company does well, share price up. Pandemic, company business model has exposed weaknesses and limitations (goes into serious debt, institutional investors bail, selling bonds and diluting shares for cash flow) and then still within the pandemic, they open their businesses again. Some 10 MAYBE 20% people go back to watch movies, and somehow share price is still going to go back up? 

The value of a company does not originate the from immediate revenue it generates. It’s the long term, stability of its business model. It’s pretty clear that AMC has since made no identifiable changes to this business model and therefore does not warrant any price adjustment in share value. 

This is how you value a company son.

I’ve already acknowledged that rev will be lower than pre-pandemic which is obvious and understandable. I didn’t expect anything more. The point is, “better than current conditions” is not going to magically make debt go away. They will barely be able to recover interest payments and cash flow will continue to burn. That’s the problem. Their ability to take loans and dilute is not infinite, at some point, the business is going to fail nonetheless without any significantly modification of business model.",TripleBrain,1,/r/stocks/comments/m1scfk/be_careful_trading_this_week/gqgmdeo/,0.126,0.73,0.145,0.7281
416,AMC," 
>Expectations do not form out of a vacuum

That is essentially said what I am saying when I say, ""Of course those expectations can be effected by how they've done compared to the past."" Expectations come from many sources. Really my only point is that the fact that AMC will likely experience an increase in revenue the year after a pandemic doesn't necessarily mean anything for the long term prospects of the stock without more context. Everyone knows that their revenue will go up. The question is how much will it go up and how sustainable is their revenue long term and how will they handle the additional debt they took on.",SteamedHamSalad,1,/r/stocks/comments/m1scfk/be_careful_trading_this_week/gqhrhqh/,0.022,0.938,0.04,0.25

418,AG," I like to use a metaphor when I think about this. Imagine you have a box that spits out money over a certain period of time. How much would you pay for that box? How much would you pay for a fraction of that box? The box is like the company, the fraction is a share. Keep that in mind when I talk about the rest of this.

There's really only two ways that money comes back to you from a company. Either it issues a dividend from its earnings, or in other company comes interested in buying it and purchases out all the shares.

In any other scenario, it's just money shifting around. If the price of a stock goes up more than a supported by the dividends from its earnings or from the future sale, then the people buying that higher price will end up losing money.

So that's the box. the only way to actually determine the value of the box, is to put it in context of other financial instruments that are available to you. For example, you can buy a bond and it so if the money that the box generates is less than the money you would get from a bond for the same price and it doesn't make sense to buy the box instead you should buy the bond.

this is where things get very tricky, because bonds are at historic Lowe's because interest rates have been suppressed due to quantitative easing because of past mistakes with world economies. Then you can rest assure that if bonds were paying out 9% like they were when I was younger, these stocks would not have the same value that they do now.

Another complication, is that you have to consider the forward earnings. what if you don't actually know how much the box is going to produce, but you have an idea and that amount of may grow over a certain period of time. maybe it's all I'm paying you one dollar per month today, but in 5 years it's going to pay you ten dollars per month. This is why growth valuation is fundamentally different than valuation of a stable company.

All that said, it doesn't make sense for Tesla to be worth more than General Motors, Ford Motor Company, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Honda Motor Company, Hyundai Motor, Daimler AG, Ferrari, BMW and Volkswagen. There's no real growth pathway that justifies that. So Tesla is a bubble no doubt. But the thing is that bubbles can stay inflated for along time and it's even possible that that price will continue to rise, just slowly compared to the economy. More likely, though, is that Tesla growth will stagnate as traditional automakers enter their space (inclusive FSD) and a lot of people will get burned.",JackLocke366,4,/r/stocks/comments/m1nobl/why_does_valuation_matter/gqeuy3k/,0.037,0.878,0.085,0.9568
419,DCF," one thing to remember about the growth stock boom is that much of it is probably caused by artifially low interest rates since 2008. as you will know, this makes stocks more attractive and leads to a lower discounting factor in a DCF, i.e. higher overall value especially for growth stocks that promise to realise their value in the future (where it is discounted with a relatively high factor). also low interest rates have decreased financing costs for ventures which are typically debt financed.  to answer your question: valuation is important to realise whether a stock is currently overprized or not. even the most optimistic DCF will tell you to stay away from tesla now. you can buy tesla if you like, but they *price* you pay for the *value* is important. there so many stocks out there that it is a really good strategy to buy the attractive ones at a time when they may be underpriced.  value as a strategy is something different... this is usually measured as a basket of companies with low P/E and P/B ratios. but valuation as such is still the only way to find out whether you can buy something valuable with good prospects at a discount or whether you are paying too much for it. the opposite strategy (not caring about value and just buying based on what goes up or is treny) is speculation. and yeah, you can ride the wave for some time, but markets are efficient in the long-run and one day it will come crashing down and destroy dreams and lifes...",buy_side_quant,2,/r/stocks/comments/m1nobl/why_does_valuation_matter/gqfk8nv/,0.051,0.741,0.208,0.9918

All that matters is whether people want the stock badly enough to keep paying higher prices for it.  Valuations might play a part in driving demand for certain stocks, but as we've seen with TSLA and the whole meme stock drama, not to mention the multi-baggers we've seen in high growth stocks with no earnings over the past year, there are lots of other factors that drive demand beyond valuations.",SirGasleak,1,/r/stocks/comments/m1nobl/why_does_valuation_matter/gqg6f1s/,0.099,0.8,0.101,0.0656

424,TV," I really think you’re going to see them be the most dominant streaming player. With their sports lineup, controlling interest in Hulu, incredible Disney+ success, dominance in content creation and ‘print money franchises’ (Star Wars, Marvel), they are super well positioned for the future of entertainment. All of that meshes with their theme park biz, and that biz will absolutely explode post-COVID.

I think Netflix has built an amazing business and changed the world, but they have not yet mastered content creation to the extent that Disney has. Netflix only has Netflix, and it will be impossible for them to compete with the existing set of content creation stalwarts that Disney brings to the table through Hulu live TV. This allows Disney to focus on super high end and high value creation only, and not spread thin which results in the trash that’s been coming out of Netflix.

I think Netflix and Disney will co-exist for a very long time, but I think consumers will have both. I think more people will pay for the high end Disney content, so I would not be surprised at all of their subscriber count ends up matching what Netflix has. Couple that with their much higher content creation ROI, AND the parks, and Hulu Live plus their sports, and I easily think you could see an 800M valuation.

430,TV," I watched that video. I while I do think that Disney is likely over-priced at the moment, I don't think it is out of sync with the wider market. I would suggest that other stocks are overpriced (though I get this is not a good reason to invest).  The video raises some interesting ideas, but the analysis looks at the last 15 years. This is pre Disney+ which I think changes the business outlook quite fundamentally.  


I think they are potentially the best in the world at monetising their content.  
Disney+ has had a fantastic reception and I think it will, with Disney's other assets, become one of the primary streaming services (already probably is). They already have content that is incredibly suitable for global audiences which include some of the most popular series ever created \[Marvel, Star Wars, 20th Century Fox (The Simpsons, Modern Family), The Muppets\]. They will also release 100+ more titles before the end of the year.  


These assets in combination with ESPN, National Geographic will help to create a full Streaming TV package, allowing users select from a whole array of TV assets. I also think this gives them much greater ability to increase pricing here. I think they should have greater pricing power than Netflix.  


I think that the re-opening of the parks etc has already been priced in, and so I am not sure exactly what would be a fair price. It is hard to say when the numbers of Disney+ subscribers increase so quickly, they have the ability to probably raise the price of it too, and it is so hard to know how quickly their parks/ cruises will re-open and what the appetite will be to go when the do re-open.

I bet if there was more transparency in the short data, this may not have happened. If however it would have, investors would make wiser decisions accordingly. 

I think everyone needs to stop targeting and belittling WSB meme enthousiastes & instead ask the real questions like:
 • why does the system allow SI to be over 100%
 • how could a system be designed to break during volatility and in turn cause halt of buying certain securities and how to reduce clearing time
 • what is really going on behind the scenes because I'm not pro but I don't think retail investors/WSB members who make monkey memes are the biggest players in this price action.

448,IMO," IMO it's a bubble, not a squeeze.

The bubble drivers are there: DFV doubling down, Cohen firing the CFO, Cohen leading a digital transformation team, and most importantly everyone thinking that a second squeeze is on.

At the reported short interest, I don't see a short squeeze happening. This run-up has been going on for 2 weeks now, and it follows on the heels off a squeeze that many shorts were probably lucky to escape. Hedge funds aren't all collectively stupid, and they'd have to be incredibly stupid to expose themselves to a short squeeze at the same prices and in the same way as 6 weeks ago.

Is the short interest fake? Maybe. But we're not really seeing ""squeezes"". We're getting steady growth (excepting parts of today). Large growth, but it's fairly linear intra-day with jumps in after/pre-market.

I don't know how high the bubble will go. It will go as long as people are buying thinking there's a squeeze coming. But when it pops its gonna be rough for anyone still holding on.

450,GME," The squeeze never really happened, as was confirmed by Melvin during the hearing and it came extremely close to breaking the financial system last time, as was confirmed by the Interactive Brokers CEO. All of this can still happen, which is why it's still trading as high as it is. Once the shorts are actually squeezed out, it will return to trading at normal levels, but that could take weeks if not months and would require the price to have extremely fast spikes first.

I'd also argue that if it does indeed skyrocket, it will have an impact on the rest of the market, so at this point not having at least 1% of your portfolio in GME is actually MORE risky than having some GME. Big funds understand this, which is why they've been buying in this last week (note how most of the moves happened during pre-market).

451,GME," I hate to break it to you, but a 20 dollar stock price will never happen again. All this attention alone has a big long term impact. I also think that you are not judging the fundamentals correctly. GME is expecting profitability this next quarter earnings, and has debts paid through 2021. They have 250M+ free cash flow, and e-commerce QoQ growth that is bursting at the seems. They are undergoing positive changes in management that indicates a business strategy change toward an e-commerce company, rather than a B&M business. They still have a 100M shelf offering they can use at any time to raise capital.

Don't be fooled thinking that GME's current SP has anything to do with fundamentals. It has everything to do with the underlying belief that shorts are still underwater and can be pinched to a squeeze (hypothetically).

457,AMD," >With Cohen at the helm of GameStop manages to rebrand they could easily become a bigger name in gaming than they ever were 

My question for you is how is GameStop supposed to be able to outcompete competitors like Steam, Amazon, and the digital stores on consoles, when they've already been severely outpaced by them for the last decade. I mean, there was a reason the stock was at under $10 for most of the year. The amount of time that it would take for GameStop to revamp its image and its whole revenue model is going to be long, and the company can't afford that time, mainly because of how their competitors are continuing to chew away at what little market share they have at this point. 

GameStop isn't likely going to be AMD, Blackberry, or Nokia, because they refused to change when it was most needed, which was a few years ago when e-commerce for gaming was just starting to ramp up.

**TLDR: The reason the C suite are diamond hands is because they are paid in stock, and they believe the stock is under valued which i believe it is too. The reason they believe this is because of their new tech focused design for new locations. This location is the new ""gig"" design that many big names are trying to test, but TACO is currently bull rushing the design for the east coast. Why does this matter? Because this location will take full advantage of the gig economy and TACO will be entirely pandemic resistant while other QSRs are not.

Start with something you understand, a company in a industry you know something about and just research them for a bit, news about them, financials, insider activity, analysts ratings, past performace etc. Look at DD posts here and other forums (there are a bit few in number right now because all the craziness but you can search for them) and see how others research stocks. Do this until you find something that seems solid with some room to grow and there's your first pick. 

Then just keeping looking at market news and forums and you'll slowly pick up on more and more bits of knowledge.

521,GME," That's not investing, though.  That's gambling.

""Aggressive"" investing isn't about taking blind, incalculable risks.  It's about mitigating risk of catastrophic loss.

Protecting principal may seem boring, but not losing money is more critical to snowballing returns over time than chasing big returns while risking similarly big losses.

82% of day traders lose money, and the 18% who don't still underperform the S&P by 1-2%.  Knowing this, let's imagine that we're investing $10,000 in one of two scenarios.  Let's imagine that the time horizon in both scenarios is 40 years.

**Scenario 1.**

Let's split the difference and say that in odd years you lose only 0.5% and in even years you underperform the S&P by 1%.  We'll be generous and say that in year five you have a GME like event and gain 600%.  We'll be even more generous and only incur the 0.5% losses every other year, and simulate no market crashes or other catastrophic losses... which is improbable but we'll keep it simple.

**Scenario 2.**

We take the $10,000 and stick it in an S&P index fund and sit on it.  Boring, right?

So which scenario would you choose?

538,PLTR," personally i'm more optimistic on apple right now than disney. 

disney is letting their politics interfere with business as they remove classic movies like dumbo and peter pan from their service (which in turn means it's probably only a matter of time until they black list the movies for bluray sales / park appearances / etc.). they're also removing people from high profile successful shows like carano on the mandalorian.

at some point, if they continue going down that route it's going to bite them in the ass. nostalgia is a powerful thing and disney is opting to throw the things people are nostalgic about in the trash while kneecapping their new content.

they're not going bankrupt or tanking any time soon, i just don't see room for massive growth above and beyond what they did this year. i picked up some shares this time last year, but don't have any plans to get more. 

aapl on the other hand while having the same politics isn't letting it interfere with their business. they'll continue to grow, and if anything comes from the ""apple car"", that stock is going to explode. (yes, i realize they probably won't ""make"" a car and will probably just partner with a company that does while providing self-driving and various other tech, but the point still stands)

as far as investing **now** goes, aapl is down a bit, while dis is at all time highs. timing wise, aapl is definitely a better pickup right now. of course, rather than going all in on one with what you go for, i'd probably put like 80% in there and then put 20% in something that isn't either of them but has the chance to grow much larger (like increasing your PLTR holdings, or grabbing SFT or something like that)",reaper527,0,/r/stocks/comments/m1perx/dis_or_aapl/gqgriad/,0.007,0.864,0.129,0.9868

593,IMO," as your core position, you want something with broad exposure to the entire US stock market. this will be a lot more safe and stable and covers a lot of industries. an S&P 500 index, Russell 1000 index, or total market index is the way to start. SYP and VOO are S&P 500 indexes, IWB is the Russell 1000, and VTSAX covers the entire US market. might want something international, too, like the Bogleheads 3 fund method. there are times US stocks do poorly but global stocks do well, and vice-versa. 

Fidelity has zero fee funds, FZROX will cover the entire US market and FZILX covers most major international stocks. but it's hard to go wrong with Vanguard, Schwab or many other good investing companies. 

the ARK etfs are what are known as ""sector funds"" -- they cover a specific industry or type of business. these are fine, and can have strong performance histories. I hold a tech and healthcare fund in my fidelity IRA. but they should be a small part of the big picture because they are also more volatile -- more ups and downs, and the management fees tend to be higher.  

>trying to start some generational wealth

this is fine as a goal, but in a way it's not up to you if wealth is generational. most inheritance is wasted within a few years, for the same reason most big lotto winners go bankrupt in a few years: they don't have the mindset and habits to handle getting a large amount of money all at once. 

so IMO a goal should also be training any kids with the right mindset and attitude about money: it's a responsibility to manage it properly, not an excuse to go on vacations and shopping sprees.",harrison_wintergreen,4,/r/stocks/comments/m1fxu7/which_index_or_etfs_to_start_building_my/gqdto8l/,0.053,0.832,0.115,0.9493

623,IEA," Oil wells naturally produce less oil every year - we call that a decline. In order to make up for declines companies need to invest heavily in capex. Due to covid every oil company began to conserve cash as oil crashed and slashed capex and shut in wells. The result is that supply is being hampered naturally in addition to opec. 

The IEA recently came out and estimated that in the short term theres an undersupply of 3.5 million barrels of oil per day. To put that in context when oil dropped in 2014-2015 there was estimated to be an oversupply of 2 million barrels per day.

Webull to prevent getting hit with massive fee's when getting transferred new customers they made a standard to make sure you have $500 before transferring as they see that as you are a serious investor (sort of a joke, since you can open an account with adding few bucks)

&#x200B;

Webull has to ""cancel"" the transfer, your $75 is NON refundable by Robinhood, and Robinhood HAS to reactive your account within a time frame (i think it might be automatic, funds go back into your account, and your account is auto-active) if i am not mistaken.

Once webull doesn't want the transfer/cancels it, Robinhood cannot deny you access to your stocks/account, it will take time for the account to go back live. I believe it is illegal for them to hold your account hostage for this. and I believe it is all automatic, RH cannot do much on their end, unless they elevate the situation and manually do something with your account.

&#x200B;

**PS#1** open a webull account, dont transfer anything unless you have thousands of dollars of stocks, so you don't get hit with tax issues. if tax is an issue and you have tons of money, i suggest you reapply with proper information to webull.

681,IMO," I am assuming you are referring to writing covered calls.  A covered put isn't really a thing.  There is a cash-secured put, however, that is totally different.

For covered calls, the biggest risk is the same as just owning the equity itself - a large decline in the value of the underlying equity.

Now, covered call writing introduces a second risk, missing out on gains during a rapid increase in equity price.  In this scenario, you calls will be assigned and your shares will be called away.

I find it odd that WeBull requires margin for covered calls.  All brokers do not require this as there should be no margin requirements since you own the underlying equity.  You should probably call them and ask about it - unless someone else who uses WeBull can explain.

Some other odds and ends, you will want to buy shares in groups of 100.  You can only safely write 1 call per 100 shares at a time.  So, depending on the equity, you may need a decent chunk of capital.

Also, IMO, I would never leave a short option position open going into expiration.  This risk is less severe for covered calls since you own the equity.  However, weird things historically happen while the markets are closed but before the exercise cutoff.  It is just not good practice imo.

And that's about everything that I can think of.  Good luck.",TrottingGelato,2,/r/stocks/comments/m1iwfl/trading_covered_options/gqe02xs/,0.066,0.842,0.093,0.7515

707,GSK," I went in quite recently, the day before the FDA approval (I think end of January), and added a bit when there was a dip afterwards.. currently holding 445 shares at 15.8.. this was a pure gamble on the expectation that it will be bought up by the likes of GSK. 

I think that might still happen, but since I am already down by around 17% (yes, -3% down since my original post), I don't know if I am ever gonna see profit even if that happens.

now and at the hour of our death. 
Amen.

724,SKT," It’s going to be a tough road back to pure profits for them. A lot of the retailers that lease their spaces have closed up shop due to COVID and it’s going to take some time to fill those vacancies back up. Their financials are worse now than they were before COVID started. So while the big growth we’ve seen in the past few months on SKT has been great, it was over aggressive when compared to the company’s actual return to profitability. There will be a bit of a correction now as a result. But with time it will grow back to the $22-25 share value.",spoonsscsu,5,/r/stocks/comments/m1fokj/gs_analysis_of_tanger_outlets_utterly_pathetic/gqdcv5b/,0.054,0.805,0.141,0.8779
