As long as the wallet you use for P2P transaction is not the same you use for exchanges then it can not be linked to you as a person. 

So at this point it is on you to be honest and pay the IRS taxes on bitcoin that can not be linked to you. I an not recommending tax evasion. Just giving a very brief explanation.

13,ETH," All currencies should be both: USD is. The opposing ideas are ""transactional currency"" and ""bullish investment"" and I don't think something can ever function well as both.

Crypto like BTC is inherently designed as an investment because it's deflationary. There is a fixed supply and less and less is introduced over time. Most BTC has already been mined (\~90%). As long as there is acknowledgement of the value, the value will only go up over time as a scare resource so if you buy it, you're setting yourself up to hold.  
Today, paying in BTC is fundamentally no different than paying with stock. Your holdings are sold at a market rate, converted back into USD, and moved to the merchant. Most merchants don't want BTC. The tax treatment and high volatility compared to traditional currencies means you will pay capital gains on purchases and likely will lock in short term capital gains which is terrible for anyone with a serious income.

Even if merchants want to accept crypto directly... any crypto with a transaction fee is disadvantageous to consumers. Merchants pay \~1.5% to 3.5% to accept credit and eat that fee as the cost of doing business. Your credit card company then shares that fee with you in terms of cash back / rewards. Crypto fees on the other hand are somewhat opaque as they're dependent on network congestion. The cost is the same regardless of the total amount of crypto being sent so for large transactions in millions of USD, that amount is cheap (cheaper and faster than a wire) but for small transactions, the fees well exceed the price of the good.

The two most common cryptos are BTC and ETH. For both, you will never see them as pervasive currencies unless they're changed into something completely different than they are today.  
\- BTC average fee is around $12 today (peak \~$30) per transaction.  
[https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin\_average\_transaction\_fee#:\~:text=Basic%20Info&text=Bitcoin%20Average%20Transaction%20Fee%20is,from%200.7393%20one%20year%20ago](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee#:~:text=Basic%20Info&text=Bitcoin%20Average%20Transaction%20Fee%20is,from%200.7393%20one%20year%20ago).  
\- ETH average fee is around $17 today (peak \~$40) per transaction. [https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum\_average\_transaction\_fee#:\~:text=Ethereum%20Average%20Transaction%20Fee%20is,K%25%20from%20one%20year%20ago](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_transaction_fee#:~:text=Ethereum%20Average%20Transaction%20Fee%20is,K%25%20from%20one%20year%20ago).

They've only steadily gone up over time. ETH you not only have transactions on the network but also smart contracts. I will go as far as to say there will never be a successful transactional crypto that 1. has fees 2. has support for smart-contracts.

There are many many people recently selling NFTs who actually paid more in gas fees than they earned...

I invest in crypto but I wouldn't ever use it for a purchase at a traditional merchant. Transactional crypto has a chance when the Fed creates a feeless stablecoin. I think even fee-less altcoins like nano & iota & others which are interesting projects are still inherently investments until the price stabilizes.",bubumamajuju,1,/r/investing/comments/mgcjkb/paypal_to_allow_americans_to_pay_with_bitcoin/gstqxna/,0.039,0.856,0.105,0.9814

Most people are looking long term in regards to c-currency. IMO, it's not going away, even if there is another significant drawdown.

If i had kept the M*nero I used to buy LSD in 2016 it would be worth an obscene amount more. Most are buying c-currency to hold for years, not to spend immediately (which defeats the point IMO, but it's become the Millenial's Gold Reserve)

Once it got to $25, a 500% return? That only took a few months. Hold until $50? That took more than 5 years. Holding for $70 again? That would have taken nearly 10 years.",FailingEfficiency,4,/r/investing/comments/mg6m07/negative_numbers_in_financial_statements/gsrs079/,0.041,0.925,0.034,-0.4568
47,DCF," Obviously it depends on the company, but one trick would be to project it for it some profit margin for the future. Perhaps there were profitable years before corona where you could get a view for a potential ""normal"" profit margin. Maybe there are other similar, but profitable companies, whose profit margin you could take as baseline. I.e assuming this company would reach the same level of profitability as another company after going through its current growth phase.

For a simple DCF analysis, I would a) try to figure out the future revenues and b) figure out the future profit margin.",sanderudam,2,/r/investing/comments/mg6m07/negative_numbers_in_financial_statements/gsrwvcb/,0.011,0.734,0.255,0.9834
48,TJX," You could attempt to work around them by using alternative ratios; P/Revenue, P/Book. You could also try going back and take an average of the past year or two or so (in the case that the negative value is unusual, which often happens). Low denominators can also make the ratios super high (price/very small earnings = 1000 P/E), so using a weighted average using xPS values is also helpful. 


But ultimately, those negative values throw wrenches in consistency and charts, so always use multiple valuation metrics. They trade places in relevance over time. When Earnings suffer, the market turns to Revenue and Book. If revenue is flat, they expect improving efficiency (earnings) or some sort of shareholder incentive (book).


Here are a few companies with negative values.

53,DCF," Essentially, you need to estimate a ""cap-to-sales"" ratio or something along those lines. For every dollar invested how many dollars of revenue are generated? For rapidly growing companies it should probably be somewhere in the range of 1.5 to 3. Investment might be marketing, r&d, production facilities, new stores, etc. Then, you need to estimate the type of margins you expect the company to reach when it becomes profitable and how long it will take to reach that point. After that you just project the cash flows as you would any DCF. The operating losses incurred until the company becomes profitable lower the value of the company because they will have to be made up for by diluting existing shareholders or raising debt, obviously.

54,DISCA," Good morning contrarians!

Futures are mixed as of 0600. Small caps are up 0.5%, rebounding from their 2.6% loss yesterday. Dow futures are up 0.2%. The S&P 500 is flat and the Nasdaq is down 0.4%.

The big story is still Archegos Capital. Yesterday I said this didn’t look like an LTCM-type of systemic event. This morning that view appears vindicated. 

Couple of reasons for this. For one, financial stocks would be on the front line of any massive unwind as many of these banks were/are counterparties not only to Archegos, but to its counterparties. But that fallout appears limited to Nomura and Credit Suisse. The XLF (ETF that tracks financials) is up 0.7% in the pre-market. 

Then you have the stocks that were at the center of Archegos’ implosion (or cover images for the story, at least): Viacom and Discovery. Both saw extensive selling from Friday through yesterday but are up in the pre-market today: VIAC by about 6%, DISCA by 1.5%. (Yeah there are a bunch of Chinese internet stocks that also figured into this story, but they have other issues affecting them).

Finally, you have the news coverage of the story. These have moved on from what you would call ‘first day’ news pieces to post-mortem type of things. A quick sample of the headlines this morning:

* “How Archegos’ $20 billion decision led to banks’ share prices tumbling”: CNBC;

* “What is Archegos and how did it rattle the stock market?” WSJ;

* “Archegos Capital blowup: What investors need to know”: Bloomberg;

* “Goldman U-turn on Hwang put bank at nexus of margin call”: Bloomberg;

Knowing a thing or two about newsrooms (from experience), I can tell you there is no way anybody would have time or interest to pursue projects like this if the bigger story about Archegos was still developing.  

Things could certainly still (d)evolve from here. There may be pockets of information about Archegos that could cause fear in the broader market. But for all intents and purposes, the story would appear to be done. In a few weeks you may have already forgotten about it.

117,CD," 1. Don't risk it on anything that's not an ETF/fund, because you can't afford to have LESS than 15K in august.
2. Your first option is a CD, which is a guaranteed return. Current rates for a 3 month is about 0.3% APY, so \~$12 in gains. It's small, but 100% risk-free gains for you.
3. If you want more than that, you'll have to take on real risk. How much less than 15K can you afford to have by august? Can you afford paying another $1000? then you can be more risky. (i.e. stocks/etfs)
4. You are want to get this money OUT of the market relatively soon, so whatever you invest in, if it rises above 15K even a little bit, sell and call it a day. I.e. if you put 15K into the S&P500, and a week later the value is 15,030. SELL. Take those gains and plop them into a 1-3 month CD (whatever time remains), and be proud you got a free $30-40.
5. Note: these all have tax implications, and will require you to pay some extra taxes next year (roughly $8 on $40 in gains).

Bottom Line: Don't use options, don't invest in a single company or single industry, and be prepared to be happy with under $100 in free money. Considering $100 in 4 months on 15K is a 2% APY return, that you were super safe with.

EDIT: I forgot about debt. If you have any debt, say a house or car, or student loans currently accruing interest, those are typically 3%+.

Example: you have a car loan with a 4.5% yield. your income is 60K, your expenses are 40K. So by August, you could save up about 7K. Therefore, you put 7K into your car loan, maybe paying it off, and lowering your auto insurance rates, and make maybe 5% on that before taxes, so 5% of 7K is: $116. If it lowers your auto insurance from 800 a year to 600 a year, then you also saved another $66. so total ""income"" in this case is \~$185.

119,NYC," Not gonna knock the TGT holdings, that's your decision, and probably a prudent one based on your convictions. 

As for the retire early, it depends on where you want to live, and how much of your expenses are held up in cost of living. 

&#x200B;

If you are only saving \~20K on a 200K income, you are either in NYC/LA/other crazy expensive place, or are doing your expenses wrong. 

&#x200B;

The normal American family only needs roughly 50-60K to meet their expenses, so you should have more like 140K to invest. Obviously taxes are at play, but that's what 401K is for, still should have maybe 100K left over to invest after taxes. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, amounts aside: 50% invested in one holding, no matter the conviction, is probably a bad move long term. Not because you are wrong, but because when you want to sell, you're actually a really big fish. For example, lets say that TGT fund grows to a solid 1.5 Million by  age 50. It's actually going to be hard for you to pull that out, without going slowly. Therefore, about 5 years before your plan on ""retiring"" you should slowly move that big holding into more diversified or liquid holdings. 

&#x200B;

You are unique in your style, but at 200K it's actually typically quite hard for you not to retire early. Why? Because at that income, social security is like 50K a year, even if they go ""bankrupt"" which is enough to retire on itself, so you only need to cover your early retirement from age, say 50-65. That's 15 years. If you save 1 Million only, and don't even invest it, instead holding cash and just pulling out the principal, that's 66K a year. 

Unless you plan on retiring in LA or NYC or want to pay for 100% of someones college or have lots of expensive vacations and multiple homes, you should only need a max 2 Million for retirement....

131,MA," Ya know I don't get the hype around BNPL services like Klarna and Affirm. Functionally they're just running a short-term consumer credit facility with a nice payment processing integration suite for vendors - a valuable service sure but it's markedly different from the incumbents in this space how exactly?

Also, while these companies have done a great job of branding, fundamentally they're still lenders, they make money when you fail to pay and when you use their services at checkout (they charge the merchant). Which again makes me ask how exactly are they different from the current incumbents like PayPal, MA, V, AMEX?

I just don't get it, maybe someone can enlighten me?",superepicunicornturd,2,/r/investing/comments/mgbyen/klarna_possible_2022_ipo/gsswpiy/,0.051,0.766,0.184,0.9402
132,MA," Credit limits and the shopping experience via the app. It first started as a company that allowed you to purchase stuff (up to a limit of course) but only started the calculation of interest after 30 days, after which you can start paying it off in installments similar to a credit card. 

The benefit here is that you can purchase lots of stuff, try them out at home, and return what you don't want without incurring interest payment. This allows you to buy more than usually without eating into your credit limit. 

Now days their apps also have sales, promos, etc as to get you to buy stuff, so you are constantly doing an instant buy. 

In short, it is now a platform that both gives you easy credit and drive sales in which to buy stuff.

MA, VISA, etc would not be able to match

The nearest would be an Amazon credit card that allows you more discounts if you buy on their platform with prime and where the credit calculations interest / limits only triggers after 30 days.",KL_boy,2,/r/investing/comments/mgbyen/klarna_possible_2022_ipo/gstn55n/,0.007,0.794,0.199,0.9908
133,MA," I guess so, as I never use the PayPal credit card. However I don’t really see MA or VISA trying to enter the space, unless they partner with a major bank as to offer the credit and they have to somehow build the shopping platform. 

I rather they keep on building their network, or maybe even buy a competitor / player in this space. God know they are big enough.",KL_boy,1,/r/investing/comments/mgbyen/klarna_possible_2022_ipo/gstxrka/,0.0,0.892,0.108,0.743

135,UK," 1 is irrelevant, any random African country is proof enough. *Purchasing power* and productiveness matters, not the number of unskilled workers and low level phone-support jobs (both which are abundant in India).



2 Also irrelevant, and not even fully true. India is ripe with corruption and bribery, the housing market is as much untaxed gray deals as legit sales. The democratic system in place is weak and the population highly divided. China, in comparison is no democracy yet an economic powerhouse. UK wasn't a democracy yet an economic powerhouse.



3. See the first point, having the world record in uneducated masses, beggars and people living below acceptable sanitary standards is not a pro. Until India manages basic education + sanitation nobody cares, poor people isn't a good market.


4. Pointless since once again *the majority are poor*. The Chinese generally don't speak English well yet its irrelevant in business. And, let's be honest, most Indians speak English on a very low level. A Swedish 13yo is easily on par with an adult Indian in terms of understanding, building sentences/grammar etc. Taht said thuose who go to good schools do get a good education...and usually migrate. *India has a severe problem with brain drain*.




5. Finally a legit good point. A big able-bodied population is good, and their low salaries/standard of living makes it easy for foreign companies to set up shop. Though are they the *cheapest* workforce? If not production goes elsewhere. If robots are chespe r(which they can be for simple jobs) jobs don't come. China is the current king of cheap labour and they're outsourcing to India in part but also Africa to get it even cheaper. Its better to invest in the *companies making profit* not the cheap production factories in some developing area.",KyivComrade,1,/r/investing/comments/mg9w4f/indiabased_plays_3_ideas_thoughts/gsubsbw/,0.088,0.865,0.047,-0.655
